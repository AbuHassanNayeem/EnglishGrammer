# LEVEL 1 — LANGUAGE SYSTEM OVERVIEW

English grammar functions as a **six-level system**:

```
PHONOLOGY (Sound) 
    ↓
MORPHOLOGY (Word Structure)
    ↓
SYNTAX (Sentence Structure)
    ↓
SEMANTICS (Meaning)
    ↓
PRAGMATICS (Use & Context)
    ↓
DISCOURSE (Extended Communication)
```

Each level builds on previous levels, creating a hierarchical understanding of the language system.

---

# LEVEL 2 — MORPHOLOGY: WORD STRUCTURE

## 2.1 Morphemes: The Basic Building Blocks

**Morpheme**: The smallest unit of meaning in a language.

### Free Morphemes
- Can stand alone as independent words
- Examples: *book*, *run*, *cat*, *happy*

### Bound Morphemes
Cannot function independently; must attach to other morphemes.

#### Inflectional Morphemes (Grammatical markers)
Modify the grammatical form without changing word class:
- **Tense**: *walk* → *walked*
- **Number**: *cat* → *cats*
- **Person/Agreement**: *I go* vs *She goes*
- **Comparison**: *fast* → *faster* → *fastest*
- **Case**: *he* → *him*

#### Derivational Morphemes (Category-changing)
Create new words, often changing word class:
- **Noun → Adjective**: *beauty* → *beautiful*
- **Verb → Noun**: *create* → *creation*
- **Adjective → Adverb**: *quick* → *quickly*
- **Zero Derivation**: *a gift* → *to gift* (no morpheme added)

---

## 2.2 Word Formation Processes

### Affixation (Prefixation / Suffixation)
- Adding prefixes or suffixes to a root word
- Examples: *un-happy*, *re-write*, *care-ful*, *care-less*

### Compounding
- Joining two independent words
- **Spaced/Open**: *bus stop*, *post office*, *tea party*
- **Hyphenated**: *mother-in-law*, *father-in-law*
- **Closed/Solid**: *snowball*, *keyboard*, *notebook*

### Conversion (Zero Derivation)
- Changing word class without adding morphemes
- Examples: *butter* (N) → *to butter* (V), *run* (N) → *to run* (V)

### Clipping
- Shortening longer words
- Examples: *advertisement* → *ad*, *telephone* → *phone*

### Blending
- Combining parts of two words
- Examples: *smoke* + *fog* → *smog*, *breakfast* + *lunch* → *brunch*

### Acronyms
- Using initial letters to form new words
- Examples: *NASA*, *SCUBA*, *RADAR*

### Back-formation
- Creating a new word by removing what seems like an affix
- Examples: *edit* (from *editor*), *burgle* (from *burglar*)

---

# LEVEL 3 — SYNTAX: SENTENCE STRUCTURE

## 3.1 The Sentence

**Definition**: A complete grammatical unit expressing a full thought.

### Sentence Types (by Structure)

#### Simple Sentence
- **One independent clause** only
- Structure: Subject + Predicate
- Example: *She studies hard.*

#### Compound Sentence
- **Two or more independent clauses** joined by coordinating conjunctions
- Conjunctions: *and, but, or, yet, so, nor*
- Example: *She studied hard **and** she passed the exam.*

#### Complex Sentence
- **One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses**
- Example: *She passed the exam **because** she studied hard.*

#### Compound-Complex Sentence
- **Two or more independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses**
- Example: *She studied hard **and** she passed the exam **because** she was determined.*

---

## 3.2 Clauses: Independent vs. Dependent

### Independent (Main) Clause
- Can stand alone as a complete sentence
- Must contain at least a subject and a finite verb
- Example: *The cat is sleeping.*

### Dependent (Subordinate) Clause
- Cannot stand alone; requires an independent clause
- Always introduced by a subordinating word (conjunction, pronoun, adverb)

#### Types by Function

**Noun Clause** (Functions as noun: subject, object, complement)
- Examples:
  - Subject: *What he said is important.*
  - Object: *I know that she is coming.*
  - Complement: *The fact is that she won.*

**Adjective (Relative) Clause** (Modifies a noun)
- Example: *The book that I read was excellent.*

**Adverbial Clause** (Modifies verb, adjective, or adverb)
- Example: *She succeeded **because** she worked hard.*

---

## 3.3 Clauses: Finite vs. Non-Finite

### Finite Clause
- Contains a **finite verb** (marked for tense and agreement)
- Example: *He goes to school.* / *She was sleeping.*

### Non-Finite Clause
- Contains a **non-finite verb** (not marked for tense)

#### To-Infinitive Clause
- Form: *to + base verb*
- Example: *To succeed is important.* / *I want to go.*

#### -ing Clause (Gerund/Participle)
- Form: *verb + -ing*
- Example: *Running is healthy.* / *I saw him entering the room.*

#### -ed Clause (Past Participle)
- Form: *verb + -ed*
- Example: *Broken windows need repair.* / *Once finished, he left.*

---

## 3.4 Phrase Structure

**Definition**: A group of words without a finite verb, functioning as a single unit.

### Types of Phrases

**Noun Phrase (NP)**
- Head: Noun or pronoun
- Structure: Determiner + Modifiers + Head + Post-modifiers
- Example: *the tall building*, *a beautiful painting*

**Verb Phrase (VP)**
- Head: Verb (lexical or auxiliary)
- Structure: Auxiliary Verbs + Main Verb + Objects/Complements
- Example: *will have been studying*, *has completed the task*

**Prepositional Phrase (PP)**
- Head: Preposition
- Structure: Preposition + Noun Phrase
- Example: *in the park*, *under the table*, *with enthusiasm*

**Adjective Phrase (AdjP)**
- Head: Adjective
- Structure: Degree modifier + Adjective + (complement)
- Example: *very happy*, *quite intelligent*, *fond of music*

**Adverb Phrase (AdvP)**
- Head: Adverb
- Structure: Degree modifier + Adverb
- Example: *very quickly*, *quite happily*, *too slowly*

## 3.5 Clause Structure: The CP–TP–VP System

This represents the **hierarchical shell** of a clause in generative syntax.

```
CP (Complementizer Phrase) — OUTER SHELL (Mood/Force)
│
├── Spec-CP: Wh-phrases / Topic / Focus
├── C (Head): Complementizers (that, if, whether, Ø)
│
└── TP (Tense Phrase) — FINITE SHELL (Agreement)
    │
    ├── Spec-TP: SUBJECT (NP/DP)
    ├── T (Head): Tense (Present, Past, Modal, Ø)
    │
    └── VP (Verb Phrase) — LEXICAL SHELL (Action/Meaning)
        │
        ├── Spec-VP: External Argument (Agent)
        ├── V (Head): Lexical Verb
        │   (Action, State, Event, Process)
        │
        └── Complements: Objects, PPs, Embedded Clauses
        └── Adjuncts: Adverbials
```

### Component Breakdown

**CP (Complementizer Phrase)**
- The outermost layer controlling mood and force
- Contains the complementizer (*that*, *if*, *whether*, or null)
- Example: *[CP that [TP she arrived]]* in "I know that she arrived"

**TP (Tense Phrase)**
- The layer responsible for finiteness and tense marking
- Subject position (Spec-TP) hosts the grammatical subject
- Tense head marks temporal information
- Example: *[TP She [T' is [VP reading]]]* in "She is reading"

**VP (Verb Phrase)**
- The innermost lexical layer containing the verb and its arguments
- The verb assigns thematic roles to its arguments
- Adjuncts attach at various levels for adverbial modification

---

### Infinitives: Base Verb Forms

#### Infinitive Phrase (INF-PHRASE)
- **Form**: *to + verb*
- **No explicit subject**
- **Example**: *To learn is important.*

- **Verb Type**: Always finite
- **Introducer**: May or may not use "that"
- **Function**: Always noun (subject, object, complement)
- **Examples**: *That she is coming is obvious.* / *I think he is honest.*

#### Key Differences

| Aspect | That-Clause | Finite Nominal Clause |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Introducer | Must use "that" | May or may not use "that" |
| Verb Type | Usually finite | Always finite |
| Function | Any clause type | Always functions as noun |

- **Verb Agreement**: *There is* (singular) vs. *There are* (plural)

#### Exam Tips
- Check if *it* or *there* lacks real referential meaning
- With *there*, verb agrees with the noun that follows
- Dummy *it* signals impersonal statements, weather, or temporal/distance information

---

### Determiners

- Example: *A very tall building stands here.*

**Degree Words (Intensifiers)**: *very, too, so, extremely, quite*
- Example: *She is very intelligent.* / *He is too tired.*

**Order of Multiple Pre-modifiers**:
1. Determiner → 2. Quantifier/Number → 3. Opinion → 4. Size → 5. Age → 6. Color → 7. Material → 8. Purpose → Noun

## 3.8 Pronouns in Detail

### Personal Pronoun Cases

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Subjective | I, you, he, she, it | we, you, they |
| Objective | me, you, him, her, it | us, you, them |
| Possessive | my, your, his, her, its | our, your, their |

#### Case Assignment Rules
- **Subjective Case**: Subject of finite verb (*She runs fast.*)
- **Objective Case**: Object of verb or preposition (*I saw him.* / *with me*)
- **Possessive Case**: Shows ownership (*My book is here.*)

#### Common Exam Traps
- Prepositions always take objective case: *for me* ✔ / *for I* ❌
- In coordinate structures: *She and I went home.* (both subjects) vs. *They invited him and me.* (both objects)
- Comparative ellipsis: *He is taller than I (am).* (formal) vs. *taller than me* (informal)

### Who vs. Whom
- **Who**: Subject position (*Who arrived?*)

- **Exam Tip**: Mentally substitute he/him (*he arrived* → *who*; *I saw him* → *whom*)

---

## 3.9 Agreement & Concord

**Definition**: Grammatical matching between sentence elements.

### Subject–Verb Agreement
- Verb must agree with subject in person and number
- Example: *She **goes*** (3rd person singular) vs. *They **go*** (3rd person plural)
- **Exam Trap**: Intervening phrases don't affect agreement
  - *The group of students **are** here.* (subject = "group", plural collective)
  - *One of the girls **has** arrived.* (subject = "one", singular)

### Pronoun–Antecedent Agreement
- Pronoun must agree with antecedent (noun it replaces)
- Example: *The girl said **she** was tired.* / *The boys said **they** were tired.*

- Changes focus: O becomes subject, S becomes agent
- Active: *The teacher taught the lesson.*
- Passive: *The lesson was taught by the teacher.*

#### Fronting / Extraposition
- **Fronting**: Moving elements to sentence-initial position
  - *The money, he didn't find.*
- **Extraposition**: Moving elements to sentence-final position
  - *It is clear [that she is brilliant].*

---

## 3.13 Coordination & Subordination

### Coordination
- Joining equal grammatical units
- **Conjunctions**: *and, but, or, yet, so, nor*
- **Structure**: Independent clause + Conjunction + Independent clause
- **Exam Focus**: Maintain parallel structure
  - ✓ *She reads **and** writes* effectively.
  - ✗ *She reads **and** writing* effectively.

### Subordination
- Joining unequal units (main + dependent clause)
- **Conjunctions**: *because, although, if, that, when, where, why, which, who*
- **Structure**: Main clause + Subordinating conjunction + Dependent clause
- Example: *She passed the exam **because** she studied hard.*

---

## 3.14 Information Structure

### Theme–Rheme (Topic–Comment)

**Theme (Topic)**: The starting point; what the sentence is about
- Typically subject position
- Example: *She worked hard.* (Theme = "She")

**Rheme (Comment)**: The new information about the theme
- Example: *She worked hard.* (Rheme = "worked hard")

### Given vs. New Information

**Given**: Information already known from context
- Example: *The cat is sleeping. **The cat** (given) is old.* (new = old)

**New**: Information introduced for the first time
- Example: *What is the cat doing? The cat is **sleeping.*** (new = sleeping)

### Focus & Emphasis

**Focus**: The part carrying the most important or new information
- Example: *She didn't eat the cake.* (neutral) vs. *She ate the **cake**, not the pie.* (focused on "cake")

**Emphasis**: Highlighting elements through stress, intonation, or word order
- **Cleft Construction**: *It was **him** who told me.* (emphasis on "him")

# LEVEL 4 — THE DETERMINER PHRASE (DP Hypothesis)

Modern generative syntax treats noun phrases as **Determiner Phrases** (DP), not simple NPs.

## 4.1 DP Structure

```
DP (Determiner Phrase)
│
├── Spec-DP: Possessor (e.g., John's)
├── D (Determiner Head): the, a, this, every, some, Ø
└── NP (Noun Phrase)
    │
    ├── Spec-NP: Modifiers (e.g., very tall)
    ├── N (Noun Head): man, water, London
    └── Complement/Modifier: in the park, who I met
```

## 4.2 D-Selection
The determiner governs what type of noun or noun phrase can follow:

- **Definite articles** (*the*): Can precede both count and mass nouns
  - *the book, the water*
- **Indefinite articles** (*a, an*): Only precede count nouns
  - *a book* ✔ / *a water* ✗
- **Demonstratives** (*this, that*): Both count and mass
  - *this book, that water*
- **Quantifiers** (*some, any, many*): Depend on count/mass
  - *many books* ✔ / *many water* ✗

---

# LEVEL 5 — ARGUMENT STRUCTURE & VALENCY

## 5.1 Valency: How Many Arguments?

**Valency** describes the number of obligatory participants a verb requires.

### Avalent (0 arguments)
- Predicate takes no arguments
- Example: *It rains.* / *It snows.*

### Monovalent (1 argument)
- Requires only a subject
- Example: *She **sleeps**.* / *The baby **cried**.*

### Bivalent (2 arguments)
- Requires subject and object
- Example: *He **eats** an apple.* / *She **likes** music.*

### Trivalent (3 arguments)
- Requires subject, direct object, and indirect object
- Example: *She **gave** him a gift.* / *I **showed** them the pictures.*

---

## 5.2 Thematic Roles (θ-Roles)

**Thematic roles** describe the semantic function of arguments in a sentence.

### Core Roles

**Agent**: The entity performing or controlling the action
- Example: *The boy* hit the ball.

**Patient/Theme**: The entity directly affected by the action
- Example: The boy hit *the ball.*

**Experiencer**: The entity experiencing a state or perception
- Example: *I* feel cold.

**Beneficiary**: The entity receiving benefit from an action
- Example: She baked a cake *for him.*

### Peripheral Roles

**Instrument**: The tool or means used to perform an action
- Example: He opened the door *with a key.*

**Location**: Where the action takes place
- Example: She works *in the park.*

**Source**: Where something originates
- Example: He came *from London.*

**Goal**: The destination or target
- Example: She went *to the store.*

---

## 5.3 Mapping Between Syntax and Semantics

Thematic roles typically map to syntactic positions:

| Thematic Role | Typical Syntactic Position |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Agent | Subject |
| Experiencer | Subject |
| Theme/Patient | Direct Object |
| Recipient/Beneficiary | Indirect Object |
| Instrument | Object of "with" |
| Location | Adverbial (PP) |

---

# LEVEL 6 — FEATURES & AGREEMENT

## 6.1 Feature System

### Nominal Features (Phi-features)

**Person**: 1st (*I, we*), 2nd (*you*), 3rd (*he, she, it, they*)

**Number**: Singular vs. Plural
- *The cat is sleeping.* (singular) vs. *The cats are sleeping.* (plural)

**Gender**: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter (visible mainly in pronouns)
- *he* (masculine), *she* (feminine), *it* (neuter)

**Case**: Subjective, Objective, Possessive (remnants in English)
- *I* (subj), *me* (obj), *my* (poss)

### Verbal Features

**Tense**: Present, Past, Future (marked by auxiliary or main verb form)

**Aspect**: Perfect (*have* + pp), Progressive (*be* + ing)

**Mood**: Indicative, Imperative, Subjunctive

**Voice**: Active (*The cat ate the fish*) vs. Passive (*The fish was eaten by the cat*)

---

## 6.2 Agreement Rules

### Subject–Verb Agreement (in English)
- **Present tense, 3rd person singular adds -s**
  - *He **walks**.* vs. *They **walk**.*
- **Irregular verbs** (e.g., *be*)
  - *I **am**, you **are**, he **is**, we **are**, they **are***

### Pronoun–Antecedent Agreement
- Pronoun must match antecedent in person and number
- Gender agreement is traditional but evolving (singular "they" is increasingly used for non-binary or unknown gender)
- Example: *The teacher said **they** would help.* / *The teacher said **she** would help.* (teacher = antecedent)

---

# LEVEL 7 — SEMANTICS: MEANING

## 7.1 Lexical Meaning

**Lexical meaning**: The inherent meaning of individual words.

### Sense Relations

**Synonymy**: Words with similar meanings
- *big* ↔ *large*, *happy* ↔ *joyful*

**Antonymy**: Words with opposite meanings
- *big* ↔ *small*, *hot* ↔ *cold*

**Hyponymy**: Hierarchical relationship (specific to general)
- *dog* is a hyponym of *animal*

**Polysemy**: One word with multiple related meanings
- *bank* (financial institution vs. side of a river)

---

## 7.2 Compositional Meaning

**Compositional Meaning**: The meaning of a phrase or sentence derived from its component parts.

- *[The] [tall] [man]* = combination of "the," "tall," and "man"
- The whole equals the sum of parts (mostly)

---

## 7.3 Ambiguity

**Lexical Ambiguity**: A word has multiple meanings
- Example: *bank* (financial vs. riverbank)

**Structural Ambiguity**: Sentence structure allows multiple interpretations
- Example: *Police help dog bite victim.* (Who bit whom?)

**Scope Ambiguity**: Quantifiers or operators can apply to different parts
- Example: *Every student read two books.* (2 books total or 2 per student?)

---

# LEVEL 8 — PRAGMATICS & DISCOURSE

## 8.1 Information Structure

### Topic and Focus

**Topic**: What the sentence is about (often the subject)
- *The cats are sleeping.* (topic = "the cats")

**Focus**: The new or highlighted information
- *The cats are **sleeping**.* (focus = "sleeping")

---

## 8.2 Cohesion: Linking Ideas

### Reference (Anaphora)
- Use of pronouns to refer back to previous nouns
- Example: *John arrived. **He** was tired.* (He = John)

### Substitution
- Replacing a noun or phrase with a substitute
- Example: *Do you have a pen? Yes, I have one.* (one = pen)

### Ellipsis
- Omitting redundant information
- Example: *She likes coffee and [she likes] tea.* (implied repetition)

### Conjunction
- Using logical connectors to relate ideas
- Example: *It was raining, **so** we stayed inside.*

---

**Expressive**: Expressing a psychological state
- Example: *Thank you!* / *I'm sorry.*

**Declarative**: Changing reality through utterance
- Example: *I pronounce you married.*

---

## 8.4 Implicature

**Implicature**: Implied meaning beyond the literal words.

### Conversational Implicature
- What is implied by following (or breaking) Grice's maxims
- Example: *Can you pass the salt?* (literal = question about ability; implicature = request)

### Maxims of Cooperative Communication
- **Quantity**: Say as much as needed, but not more
- **Quality**: Say what you believe to be true
- **Relevance**: Say something relevant
- **Manner**: Be clear and orderly

---

## 8.5 Discourse Structure

### Coherence vs. Cohesion
- **Coherence**: Ideas make logical sense together
