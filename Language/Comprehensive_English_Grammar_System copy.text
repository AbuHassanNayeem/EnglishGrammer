# THE COMPLETE ENGLISH GRAMMAR SYSTEM: ARCHITECTURAL TREE

This document integrates descriptive English grammar with deep linguistic structures (Generative Syntax, DP-Hypothesis, and Argument Structure) to provide a 360-degree view of the language system.

## 🌍 LEVEL 1 — THE LANGUAGE OVERVIEW
**[PHONOLOGY] → [MORPHOLOGY] → [SYNTAX] → [SEMANTICS] → [PRAGMATICS] → [DISCOURSE]**

---

## 🧱 LEVEL 2 — MORPHOLOGY (Word Structure)
The internal structure of words and the rules of formation.

**MORPHOLOGY**
│
├── **MORPHEMES**
│   ├── **Free**: Can stand alone (e.g., *book*, *run*)
│   └── **Bound**: Must be attached (e.g., *-s*, *un-*, *-ly*)
│
├── **INFLECTION** (Grammatical markers)
│   ├── **Tense**: (e.g., *walk* → *walked*)
│   ├── **Number**: (e.g., *cat* → *cats*)
│   ├── **Person**: (e.g., *I go* vs *She goes*)
│   ├── **Comparison**: (e.g., *fast* → *faster* → *fastest*)
│   └── **Case**: (e.g., *he* → *him*)
│
├── **DERIVATION** (Category changing)
│   ├── **Noun → Adjective**: (e.g., *beauty* → *beautiful*)
│   ├── **Verb → Noun**: (e.g., *create* → *creation*)
│   ├── **Adjective → Adverb**: (e.g., *quick* → *quickly*)
│   └── **Zero Derivation**: (e.g., *to butter* from *butter*)
│
└── **WORD FORMATION PROCESSES**
    ├── **Prefixation / Suffixation** (Affixation)
    ├── **Compounding**: (*sunflower*, *stone wall*)
    ├── **Conversion**: (*a gift* → *to gift*)
    ├── **Clipping**: (*advertisement* → *ad*)
    ├── **Blending**: (*smoke* + *fog* → *smog*)
    ├── **Acronym**: (*NASA*)
    └── **Back-formation**: (*editor* → *edit*)

## 🏛️ LEVEL 3 — SYNTAX (The Core Engine)
The arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences.

### 3.1 SENTENCE FORCE & TYPES

    ├── **Compound**: Two+ independent clauses (using *and, but, or*).
    ├── **Complex**: One independent + one+ dependent clauses.
    └── **Compound-Complex**: Two+ independent + one+ dependent clauses.

### 3.2 THE CP–TP–VP PROJECTION SYSTEM (Deep Structure)
This represents the hierarchical "shell" of a clause.

**CLAUSE (CP)**
│
├── **CP (Complementizer Phrase)** — *The Outer Shell (Mood/Force)*
│   ├── **Spec-CP**: Wh-phrase movement / Topic / Focus
│   └── **C (Head)**: Complementizers (*that, if, whether, Ø*)
│
├── **TP (Tense Phrase)** — *The Finite Shell (Agreement)*
│   ├── **Spec-TP**: **Subject** (The NP/DP filling the subject slot)
│   └── **T (Head)**: Tense (*Present, Past, Modal, Ø*)
│
└── **VP (Verb Phrase)** — *The Lexical Shell (Action/Meaning)*
    ├── **Spec-VP**: External Argument (**Agent**)
    ├── **V' (V-bar)**
    │   ├── **V (Head)**: Lexical Verb (*Action, State, Event, Process*)
    │   └── **Complement**: **Objects** (NP/DP), **PPs**, or **Embedded Clauses**

│   │   │   ├── **Infinitive Phrase (INF-PHRASE)**
│   │   │   │   ├── **To + Verb** (*to learn*)
│   │   │   │   ├── **Example**: "To learn is important."
│   │   │   │   │       - "To learn" acts as the **subject** of the sentence.
│   │   │   │   │       - No explicit subject inside the infinitive.
│   │   │   │   └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │   │           • Singular verb agreement: *To read books is fun.* ✅
│   │   │   │           • Avoid plural verb with infinitive subject: *To read books are fun.* ❌
│   │   │   │           • Think of INF-PHRASE as a **simpler noun-like structure**
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   └── **Infinitival Clause (INF-CLAUSE)**
│   │   │       ├── **Subject (NP)**
│   │   │       │   └── **Pronoun** (*him*)
│   │   │       ├── **To + Verb** (*to learn*)
│   │   │       ├── **Example**: "For him to learn is important."
│   │   │       │       - "him" is the explicit subject of the infinitival clause.
│   │   │       │       - The clause as a whole functions as the **subject** of the sentence.
│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │               • Usually starts with **for + pronoun**.
│   │   │               • Think of INF-CLAUSE as a **mini-sentence embedded** in the main sentence.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **That-Clause / Finite Nominal Clause**: (*That he failed is sad*)
│   │   │   ├── **1. That-Clause**
│   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: Subordinate clause introduced by "that"
│   │   │   │   ├── **Function**: Can act as noun, adjective, or adverb
│   │   │   │   ├── **Verb Type**: Usually finite (tense-marked)
│   │   │   │   ├── **Key Point**: "That" is explicitly present (optional in informal speech)
│   │   │   │   ├── **Examples**
│   │   │   │   │   ├── I know that she is coming. (object of "know")
│   │   │   │   │   └── It is clear that he made a mistake. (subject complement)
│   │   │   │   └── **Note**: Often overlaps with finite nominal clauses
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   ├── **2. Finite Nominal Clause**
│   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: Clause that behaves like a noun (subject, object, or complement)
│   │   │   │   ├── **Verb Type**: Always finite (tense-marked, agrees with subject)
│   │   │   │   ├── **Introducer**: May or may not begin with "that"
│   │   │   │   ├── **Examples**
│   │   │   │   │   ├── That she is coming is obvious. (subject)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── I think he is honest. (object)
│   │   │   │   │   └── It seems that they have left. (subject complement)
│   │   │   │   └── **Exam Tip**: Acts like a noun → finite nominal clause
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   ├── **Key Differences**
│   │   │   │   ├── **Introducer**
│   │   │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Must use "that" (optional in informal speech)
│   │   │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: May or may not use "that"
│   │   │   │   ├── **Verb Type**
│   │   │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Usually finite
│   │   │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: Always finite
│   │   │   │   ├── **Function**
│   │   │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Any clause type (noun, adj, adv)
│   │   │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: Always functions as a noun
│   │   │   │   └── **Examples**
│   │   │   │       ├── That-Clause: I know that he is right.
│   │   │   │       └── Finite Nominal Clause: That he is right is obvious.
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   └── **Quick Tip / Exam Tip**
│   │   │       ├── If it acts like a noun → finite nominal clause
│   │   │       ├── If it starts explicitly with "that" → that-clause
│   │   │       └── Most that-clauses are finite nominal clauses, but not all finite nominal clauses require "that"
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Dummy/Expletive Subject**: (*It* rains, *There* are cats)
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   A subject that does not refer to a real entity, person, or thing. It is syntactic and required for sentence structure but has no semantic content. 
│   │   │   │   These subjects are often called "formal subjects."
│   │   │   ├── **Function**: 
│   │   │   │   - Fills the subject position in sentences where no real subject exists.
│   │   │   │   - Helps maintain grammatical correctness in English, especially in sentences with weather, existential statements, or delayed subjects.
│   │   │   │   - Often paired with verbs like **be**, **seem**, **appear**, or weather verbs (**rain, snow, thunder**).
│   │   │   ├── **Types**:
│   │   │   │   ├── **Expletive It** (Weather, Time, Distance, Impersonal):
│   │   │   │   │   - *It* rains. (Weather)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It is 5 o’clock.* (Time)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It is far to the station.* (Distance)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It seems that she is right.* (Impersonal)
│   │   │   │   └── **Expletive There** (Existential):
│   │   │   │       - Introduces the existence of something.
│   │   │   │       - *There are cats in the garden.*  
│   │   │   │       - *There is a problem with the plan.*
│   │   │   ├── **Examples**:
│   │   │   │   ├── Weather/Impersonal It:
│   │   │   │   │   - It is raining.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It is cold today.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It seems impossible.  
│   │   │   │   ├── Time/Distance It:
│   │   │   │   │   - It is 10 o’clock.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It is a long way to the station.  
│   │   │   │   ├── Existential There:
│   │   │   │   │   - There is a book on the table.  
│   │   │   │   │   - There were many people at the event.  
│   │   │   ├── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │   │   - Always check if *it* or *there* is filling a syntactic slot without a real entity—if yes, it’s likely a dummy subject.  
│   │   │   │   - With **there**, the verb agrees with the **noun after it**:  
│   │   │   │       - There **is** a cat.  
│   │   │   │       - There **are** cats.  
│   │   │   │   - Dummy *it* often signals **impersonal statements**, **weather**, or **distance/time**; do not confuse with referential *it* (e.g., *I found it*).  
│   │   │   │   - Useful in formal writing to start sentences smoothly before introducing the real subject:  
│   │   │   │       - *It is important to study daily.*
│   │   │   └── **Related Concepts**:
│   │   │       - **Delayed Subject**: The real subject comes later, e.g., *It is important that you study*.  
│   │   │       - **Anticipatory It**: *It seems that…*, anticipates the actual subject in the that-clause.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Determiners (Det)**
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   Words placed before nouns to clarify reference, quantity, possession, or definiteness. 
│   │   │   │   Determiners are essential in forming noun phrases and specify **which** or **how many** of something is being referred to.  
│   │   │   ├── **Functions**: 
│   │   │   │   - Specify **definiteness/indefiniteness** (*the book* vs *a book*).  
│   │   │   │   - Indicate **quantity or amount** (*few students, many ideas*).  
│   │   │   │   - Show **possession or association** (*my house, her book*).  
│   │   │   │   - Point to **specific entities** (*this pen, those books*).  
│   │   │   │   - Introduce **numbers or order** (*first prize, three apples*).  
│   │   │   └── **Types of Determiners**:
│   │   │       ├── **Articles**:
│   │   │       │   - **Definite Article**: *the* → refers to a specific entity.

│   │   │       │     - Example: *I saw a cat in the garden.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Use *a* before consonant sounds, *an* before vowel sounds (*a university, an apple*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Demonstratives**:
│   │   │       │   - Words that indicate **proximity or distance**: *this, that, these, those*.  
│   │   │       │   - Example: *This book is mine. Those chairs are old.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Singular vs plural → *this/that* (singular), *these/those* (plural).

│   │   │       │     - *All the cookies are gone.*  
│   │   │       │     - *Each child received a gift.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Some quantifiers work with **countable nouns** (*few, many*), others with **uncountable nouns** (*little, much*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Numbers**:

│   │   │       │   - Examples: *Her dress is beautiful. Whose bag is this?*

│   │   │       ├── **Interrogative Determiners**:
│   │   │       │   - Used to ask questions: *which, what, whose*.

│   │   │           - Determiners always appear **before adjectives (if any) and nouns**: *the red car*, *my best friend*.  
│   │   │           - Most determiners **cannot be used together**: *the my book ❌*, *some few books ❌*.  
│   │   │           - Count vs uncount nouns affect choice of determiners: *many books (countable), much water (uncountable)*.

│   │   ├── **Pre-modifiers**
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   Words, phrases, or clauses that come **before the noun** to add information, describe, quantify, or limit the noun. They form part of the **noun phrase** and modify the head noun.  
│   │   │   ├── **Functions**: 
│   │   │   │   - Describe quality or attribute (*adjectives*).  
│   │   │   │   - Specify degree or intensity (*degree words*).  
│   │   │   │   - Provide limiting or identifying information (*numbers, determiners*).  
│   │   │   │   - Give additional descriptive information (*participial or relative clauses used as adjectives*).  
│   │   │   └── **Types of Pre-modifiers**:
│   │   │       ├── **Adjective Phrases**:
│   │   │       │   - Single adjectives: *tall, beautiful, intelligent*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The tall man is my uncle.*  
│   │   │       │   - Adjective + modifier: *very tall, extremely happy, quite interesting*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *A very tall building stands here.*  
│   │   │       │   - Participial phrases (functioning as adjectives): *running water, broken window, crying child*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The crying baby needs attention.*  
│   │   │       │   - Relative clauses used as adjectives (pre-nominal, less common in English but possible in formal or poetic style): *the man who I met yesterday*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The students who studied hard passed the exam.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Degree Words (Intensifiers/Modifiers)**:
│   │   │       │   - Modify the adjective to indicate intensity, amount, or limitation.  
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *very, too, enough, so, extremely, quite, too much, too little*  
│   │   │       │   - Example sentences:

│   │   │       │     - *He is too tired to continue.*  
│   │   │       │     - *There is enough water for everyone.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Other Pre-modifiers** (optional extension for exams):
│   │   │       │   - **Numbers**: *three apples, first prize*  
│   │   │       │   - **Demonstratives**: *this book, those chairs*  
│   │   │       │   - **Possessives**: *my house, her idea*  
│   │   │       │   - **Quantifiers**: *many people, few options*  
│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │           - Pre-modifiers **always come before the head noun**.  
│   │   │           - Multiple pre-modifiers follow this order (general rule):  
│   │   │             1. Determiner → 2. Quantifier/Number → 3. Opinion/Adjective → 4. Size/Shape → 5. Age → 6. Color → 7. Material → 8. Purpose/Qualifier → Noun  
│   │   │             - Example: *The three large old brown wooden dining tables*  
│   │   │           - Degree words usually **precede adjectives** (*very tall*, *too little water*).  
│   │   │           - Participial phrases often **describe the noun** directly (*the running horse, the broken vase*).  
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Post-modifiers**
│   │       ├── **Definition**: 
│   │       │   Words, phrases, or clauses that **come after the noun** to provide additional information, clarify, or describe it. 
│   │       │   Post-modifiers are part of the **noun phrase** and refine the meaning of the head noun.  
│   │       ├── **Functions**: 
│   │       │   - Give extra descriptive information about the noun.  
│   │       │   - Identify or restrict the reference of the noun.  
│   │       │   - Add precision or context.  
│   │       └── **Types of Post-modifiers**:
│   │           ├── **Relative Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses introduced by relative pronouns (*who, whom, whose, which, that*) or relative adverbs (*where, when, why*).  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man who I met yesterday is my teacher.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *I visited the town where I was born.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Relative clauses can be **defining/restrictive** (essential to the meaning) or **non-defining/non-restrictive** (extra information, usually with commas).  
│   │           ├── **Prepositional Phrases**:
│   │           │   - Phrases starting with a preposition that describe **location, time, cause, purpose, or relation**.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The book on the table belongs to Sarah.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man with the hat is my uncle.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Prepositional phrases as post-modifiers always **follow the noun they modify**.  
│   │           ├── **Non-finite Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses with verbs in **-ing (gerund/participle), -ed (past participle), or infinitive (to + verb)** forms.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* (Present participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *The letter written by her was beautiful.* (Past participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *He is the person to ask for help.* (Infinitive)  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Non-finite clauses are **concise alternatives** to relative clauses and often avoid repeating pronouns (*who, which*).  
│   │           ├── **Other Post-modifiers** (optional extensions for exams):
│   │           │   - **Appositive phrases**: Renames or explains the noun.  
│   │           │     - Example: *My friend, a talented musician, won the competition.*  
│   │           │   - **Adjective phrases after noun** (less common, for emphasis): *something useful, nothing important*  
│   │           └── **General Exam Tips**:
│   │               - Post-modifiers **always follow the noun**, unlike pre-modifiers.  
│   │               - Multiple post-modifiers can be combined:  
│   │                 - *The book on the table that I bought yesterday is mine.*  
│   │               - Non-finite clauses can replace relative clauses for conciseness:  
│   │                 - *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* = *The man who is standing near the gate is my friend.*
