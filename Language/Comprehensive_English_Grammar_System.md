### **1. SYNTAX (Sentence Structure)**

│
├── **1.1 Sentence**
│   ├── **Definition**: A complete grammatical unit expressing a full thought.
│   ├── **Types**: Simple / Compound / Complex / Compound-Complex
│   └── **Internal Structure**: Clause → Phrase → Word
│
├── **1.2 Clause**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:

│   │
│   ├── **Types by Independence**
│   │   ├── **Independent (Main Clause)**
│   │   │   └── Can stand alone as a complete sentence.
│   │   │       - Example: *She studies hard.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Dependent (Subordinate Clause)**
│   │       ├── Cannot stand alone; must be attached to a main clause.
│   │       ├── **Noun Clause** (Acts as noun: subject, object, complement)
│   │       │   - Example: *What he said* is important. / *I know that she is coming.*
│   │       ├── **Adjective (Relative) Clause** (Modifies a noun)
│   │       │   - Example: *The book that I read* was excellent.
│   │       └── **Adverbial Clause** (Modifies a verb, adjective, or adverb)
│   │           - Example: *She succeeded because she worked hard.*
│   │
│   ├── **Types by Verb Form**
│   │   ├── **Finite Clause**
│   │   │   └── Contains a finite verb (marked for tense and agreement).
│   │   │       - Example: *He goes to school.* / *She was sleeping.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Non-finite Clause**
│   │       ├── Contains a non-finite verb (not marked for tense).
│   │       ├── **To-infinitive**
│   │       │   - Form: *to + base verb* (e.g., *to walk, to study*)
│   │       │   - Example: *To succeed is important.* / *I want to go.*
│   │       ├── **-ing Clause (Gerund/Participle)**
│   │       │   - Form: *verb + -ing* (e.g., *walking, studying*)
│   │       │   - Example: *Running is healthy.* / *I saw him entering the room.*
│   │       └── **-ed Clause (Past Participle)**
│   │           - Form: *verb + -ed* (e.g., *walked, broken*)
│   │           - Example: *Broken windows need repair.* / *Once finished, he left.*
│   │
│   └── **Exam Tip**:
│       └── A sentence may contain multiple clauses, but at least one independent clause is required for it to be a complete sentence.
│
├── **1.3 Phrase**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:
│   │   └── A group of words without a finite verb, functioning as a single unit.
│   │
│   ├── **Types**
│   │   ├── **Noun Phrase (NP)**
│   │   │   - Head: Noun or pronoun
│   │   │   - Example: *the tall building* / *a beautiful painting*
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Verb Phrase (VP)**
│   │   │   - Head: Verb (lexical or auxiliary)
│   │   │   - Example: *will have been studying* / *has completed*
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Prepositional Phrase (PP)**
│   │   │   - Head: Preposition
│   │   │   - Example: *in the park* / *under the table*
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Adjective Phrase (AdjP)**
│   │   │   - Head: Adjective
│   │   │   - Example: *very happy* / *quite intelligent*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Adverb Phrase (AdvP)**
│   │       - Head: Adverb
│   │       - Example: *very quickly* / *quite happily*
│   │
│   └── **Exam Trap**:
│       └── Phrase ≠ Clause → A clause MUST have a Subject + Finite Verb.
│
├── **1.4 Grammatical Functions**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:
│   │   └── The syntactic role played by constituents in a sentence.
│   │
│   ├── **Core Functions**
│   │   ├── **Subject**
│   │   │   - The doer or focus of the action/state.
│   │   │   - Example: *She plays guitar.* / *The cat is sleeping.*
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Predicate**
│   │   │   - The verb phrase expressing the action or state.
│   │   │   - Example: *She* **plays guitar.** / *The cat* **is sleeping.**
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Object**
│   │   │   ├── **Direct Object**
│   │   │   │   - The recipient of the action (affected entity).
│   │   │   │   - Example: *She plays* **guitar.** / *I eat* **an apple.**
│   │   │   │
│   │   │   └── **Indirect Object**
│   │   │       - The beneficiary or recipient (receives the benefit of action).
│   │   │       - Example: *I gave* **him** *a gift.* / *She sent* **me** *a message.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Complement**
│   │       ├── **Subject Complement**
│   │       │   - Follows a linking verb; identifies or describes the subject.
│   │       │   - Example: *She is* **a teacher.** / *He seems* **happy.**
│   │       │
│   │       └── **Object Complement**
│   │           - Follows the direct object; identifies or describes it.
│   │           - Example: *They elected him* **president.** / *I painted the door* **blue.**
│   │
│   └── **Exam Focus**:
│       └── **Form ≠ Function** → A Noun Phrase can serve as Subject, Object, or Complement depending on its position.
│
├── **1.5 Constituents & Structure**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:
│   │   └── The hierarchical organization of sentence elements into smaller units.
│   │
│   ├── **Concepts**
│   │   ├── **Head**
│   │   │   - The main word of a phrase (determines the phrase type).
│   │   │   - Example: In "the beautiful garden", **garden** is the head (NP).
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Modifier**
│   │   │   - Words/phrases that add information about the head.
│   │   │   - Example: In "the beautiful garden", **beautiful** modifies **garden**.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Complement**
│   │   │   - Obligatory elements that complete the meaning of the head.
│   │   │   - Example: In "the destruction of the city", **of the city** complements **destruction**.
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Specifier**
│   │       - Occurs at the beginning of a phrase; determines specificity/scope.
│   │       - Example: In "the [beautiful garden]", **the** is the specifier.
│   │
│   └── **Tools**
│       ├── **Phrase Structure Rules**: Formal notation for building phrases
│       │   - Example: NP → Det + Adj* + N + PP*
│       │
│       └── **Tree Diagrams**: Visual representations of sentence structure
│           - Shows hierarchical relationships between constituents
│
├── **1.6 Word Order**
│   │
│   ├── **Basic Pattern**
│   │   └── **S + V + O** (English is SVO: Subject-Verb-Object)
│   │       - Example: *The boy* **hit** *the ball.*
│   │       - Example: *She* **eats** *fruit.*
│   │
│   ├── **Variations**
│   │   ├── **Inversion**
│   │   │   - Reversal of normal word order for emphasis, questions, or formality.
│   │   │   - Example (Question): *Does she eat fruit?* (V-S-O)
│   │   │   - Example (Emphasis): *Never have I seen such beauty.* (Neg-V-S)
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Passive Voice**
│   │   │   - Changes focus: O becomes subject, S becomes agent phrase.
│   │   │   - Active: *The teacher taught the lesson.*
│   │   │   - Passive: *The lesson was taught by the teacher.* (O-V-Agent)
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Fronting / Extraposition**
│   │       - Moving elements to sentence-initial or final positions.
│   │       - Fronting: *The money, he didn't find.*
│   │       - Extraposition: *It is clear [that she is brilliant].*
│   │
│   └── **Exam Tip**:
│       └── Questions often test inversion patterns, especially after negative adverbs or in emphatic constructions.
│
├── **1.7 Agreement & Concord**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:
│   │   └── Grammatical matching between sentence elements (morphological consistency).
│   │
│   ├── **Types**
│   │   ├── **Subject–Verb Agreement**
│   │   │   - The verb must agree with the subject in person and number.
│   │   │   - Example: *She **goes*** (3rd person singular) vs *They **go*** (3rd person plural)
│   │   │   - Example: *The cat **is** sleeping.* vs *The cats **are** sleeping.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Pronoun–Antecedent Agreement**
│   │       - A pronoun must agree with its antecedent (the noun it replaces).
│   │       - Example: *The girl said **she** was tired.* / *The boys said **they** were tired.*
│   │
│   └── **Exam Trap**:
│       └── **Intervening phrases do NOT affect agreement** → Agreement is based on the grammatical subject, not the nearest noun.
│           - Example: *The group of students **are** here.* (subject = "group", plural collective)
│           - Example: *One of the girls **has** arrived.* (subject = "one", singular)
│
├── **1.8 Government & Case**
│   │
│   ├── **Definition**:
│   │   └── How verbs/prepositions assign grammatical case (morphological marking of function).
│   │
│   ├── **Cases** (Remnants in English, stronger in other languages)
│   │   ├── **Subjective (Nominative)**
│   │   │   - Used for subjects.
│   │   │   - Pronouns: *I, he, she, they, we, you*
│   │   │   - Example: *I went to the store.*
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Objective (Accusative)**
│   │   │   - Used for direct objects and objects of prepositions.
│   │   │   - Pronouns: *me, him, her, them, us, you*
│   │   │   - Example: *She gave **me** a gift.* / *Come with **us**.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Possessive (Genitive)**
│   │       - Shows ownership or relationship.
│   │       - Pronouns: *my, his, her, our, their, your, its*
│   │       - Example: ***My** house is large.* / *The book is **his**.*

│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips**:

│   │   ├── **Dummy/Expletive Subject**: (*It* rains, *There* are cats)
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   A subject that does not refer to a real entity, person, or thing. It is syntactic and required for sentence structure but has no semantic content. 
│   │   │   │   These subjects are often called "formal subjects."
│   │   │   ├── **Function**: 
│   │   │   │   - Fills the subject position in sentences where no real subject exists.
│   │   │   │   - Helps maintain grammatical correctness in English, especially in sentences with weather, existential statements, or delayed subjects.
│   │   │   │   - Often paired with verbs like **be**, **seem**, **appear**, or weather verbs (**rain, snow, thunder**).
│   │   │   ├── **Types**:
│   │   │   │   ├── **Expletive It** (Weather, Time, Distance, Impersonal):
│   │   │   │   │   - *It* rains. (Weather)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It is 5 o’clock.* (Time)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It is far to the station.* (Distance)  
│   │   │   │   │   - *It seems that she is right.* (Impersonal)
│   │   │   │   └── **Expletive There** (Existential):
│   │   │   │       - Introduces the existence of something.
│   │   │   │       - *There are cats in the garden.*  
│   │   │   │       - *There is a problem with the plan.*
│   │   │   ├── **Examples**:
│   │   │   │   ├── Weather/Impersonal It:
│   │   │   │   │   - It is raining.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It is cold today.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It seems impossible.  
│   │   │   │   ├── Time/Distance It:
│   │   │   │   │   - It is 10 o’clock.  
│   │   │   │   │   - It is a long way to the station.  
│   │   │   │   ├── Existential There:
│   │   │   │   │   - There is a book on the table.  
│   │   │   │   │   - There were many people at the event.  
│   │   │   ├── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │   │   - Always check if *it* or *there* is filling a syntactic slot without a real entity—if yes, it’s likely a dummy subject.  
│   │   │   │   - With **there**, the verb agrees with the **noun after it**:  
│   │   │   │       - There **is** a cat.  
│   │   │   │       - There **are** cats.  
│   │   │   │   - Dummy *it* often signals **impersonal statements**, **weather**, or **distance/time**; do not confuse with referential *it* (e.g., *I found it*).  
│   │   │   │   - Useful in formal writing to start sentences smoothly before introducing the real subject:  
│   │   │   │       - *It is important to study daily.*
│   │   │   └── **Related Concepts**:
│   │   │       - **Delayed Subject**: The real subject comes later, e.g., *It is important that you study*.  
│   │   │       - **Anticipatory It**: *It seems that…*, anticipates the actual subject in the that-clause.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Determiners (Det)**
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   Words placed before nouns to clarify reference, quantity, possession, or definiteness. 
│   │   │   │   Determiners are essential in forming noun phrases and specify **which** or **how many** of something is being referred to.  
│   │   │   ├── **Functions**: 
│   │   │   │   - Specify **definiteness/indefiniteness** (*the book* vs *a book*).  
│   │   │   │   - Indicate **quantity or amount** (*few students, many ideas*).  
│   │   │   │   - Show **possession or association** (*my house, her book*).  
│   │   │   │   - Point to **specific entities** (*this pen, those books*).  
│   │   │   │   - Introduce **numbers or order** (*first prize, three apples*).  
│   │   │   └── **Types of Determiners**:
│   │   │       ├── **Articles**:
│   │   │       │   - **Definite Article**: *the* → refers to a specific entity.  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The dog barked loudly.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Indefinite Articles**: *a, an* → refers to a non-specific entity.  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *I saw a cat in the garden.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Use *a* before consonant sounds, *an* before vowel sounds (*a university, an apple*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Demonstratives**:
│   │   │       │   - Words that indicate **proximity or distance**: *this, that, these, those*.  
│   │   │       │   - Example: *This book is mine. Those chairs are old.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Singular vs plural → *this/that* (singular), *these/those* (plural).  
│   │   │       ├── **Quantifiers**:
│   │   │       │   - Express **quantity or amount** of nouns: *some, any, every, no, few, many, much, most, all, half, both, either, neither, each, one, another, others*.  
│   │   │       │   - Examples:  
│   │   │       │     - *Few students passed the exam.*  
│   │   │       │     - *All the cookies are gone.*  
│   │   │       │     - *Each child received a gift.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Some quantifiers work with **countable nouns** (*few, many*), others with **uncountable nouns** (*little, much*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Numbers**:
│   │   │       │   - Cardinal numbers: *one, two, three…* (indicate quantity)  
│   │   │       │   - Ordinal numbers: *first, second, third…* (indicate position/order)  
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *I have three books. She won first prize.*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Numbers as determiners always precede nouns (*three apples*, not *apples three*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Possessives**:
│   │   │       │   - Show **ownership or relationship**: *my, your, his, her, its, our, their, whose*.  
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *Her dress is beautiful. Whose bag is this?*  
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Possessive determiners must match the **owner** and are followed by the noun (*my book*, not *mine book*).  
│   │   │       ├── **Interrogative Determiners**:
│   │   │       │   - Used to ask questions: *which, what, whose*.  
│   │   │       │   - Example: *Which color do you prefer? Whose bag is this?*  
│   │   │       ├── **Distributive Determiners**:
│   │   │       │   - Show distribution or individuality: *each, every, either, neither*.  
│   │   │       │   - Example: *Each student must submit homework. Neither option is suitable.*  
│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips (General)**:
│   │   │           - Determiners always appear **before adjectives (if any) and nouns**: *the red car*, *my best friend*.  
│   │   │           - Most determiners **cannot be used together**: *the my book ❌*, *some few books ❌*.  
│   │   │           - Count vs uncount nouns affect choice of determiners: *many books (countable), much water (uncountable)*.  
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Pre-modifiers**
│   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   Words, phrases, or clauses that come **before the noun** to add information, describe, quantify, or limit the noun. 
│   │   │   │   They form part of the **noun phrase** and modify the head noun.  
│   │   │   ├── **Functions**: 
│   │   │   │   - Describe quality or attribute (*adjectives*).  
│   │   │   │   - Specify degree or intensity (*degree words*).  
│   │   │   │   - Provide limiting or identifying information (*numbers, determiners*).  
│   │   │   │   - Give additional descriptive information (*participial or relative clauses used as adjectives*).  
│   │   │   └── **Types of Pre-modifiers**:
│   │   │       ├── **Adjective Phrases**:
│   │   │       │   - Single adjectives: *tall, beautiful, intelligent*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The tall man is my uncle.*  
│   │   │       │   - Adjective + modifier: *very tall, extremely happy, quite interesting*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *A very tall building stands here.*  
│   │   │       │   - Participial phrases (functioning as adjectives): *running water, broken window, crying child*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The crying baby needs attention.*  
│   │   │       │   - Relative clauses used as adjectives (pre-nominal, less common in English but possible in formal or poetic style): *the man who I met yesterday*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The students who studied hard passed the exam.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Degree Words (Intensifiers/Modifiers)**:
│   │   │       │   - Modify the adjective to indicate intensity, amount, or limitation.  
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *very, too, enough, so, extremely, quite, too much, too little*  
│   │   │       │   - Example sentences:  
│   │   │       │     - *She is very intelligent.*  
│   │   │       │     - *He is too tired to continue.*  
│   │   │       │     - *There is enough water for everyone.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Other Pre-modifiers** (optional extension for exams):
│   │   │       │   - **Numbers**: *three apples, first prize*  
│   │   │       │   - **Demonstratives**: *this book, those chairs*  
│   │   │       │   - **Possessives**: *my house, her idea*  
│   │   │       │   - **Quantifiers**: *many people, few options*  
│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │           - Pre-modifiers **always come before the head noun**.  
│   │   │           - Multiple pre-modifiers follow this order (general rule):  
│   │   │             1. Determiner → 2. Quantifier/Number → 3. Opinion/Adjective → 4. Size/Shape → 5. Age → 6. Color → 7. Material → 8. Purpose/Qualifier → Noun  
│   │   │             - Example: *The three large old brown wooden dining tables*  
│   │   │           - Degree words usually **precede adjectives** (*very tall*, *too little water*).  
│   │   │           - Participial phrases often **describe the noun** directly (*the running horse, the broken vase*).  
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Post-modifiers**
│   │       ├── **Definition**: 
│   │       │   Words, phrases, or clauses that **come after the noun** to provide additional information, clarify, or describe it. 
│   │       │   Post-modifiers are part of the **noun phrase** and refine the meaning of the head noun.  
│   │       ├── **Functions**: 
│   │       │   - Give extra descriptive information about the noun.  
│   │       │   - Identify or restrict the reference of the noun.  
│   │       │   - Add precision or context.  
│   │       └── **Types of Post-modifiers**:
│   │           ├── **Relative Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses introduced by relative pronouns (*who, whom, whose, which, that*) or relative adverbs (*where, when, why*).  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man who I met yesterday is my teacher.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *I visited the town where I was born.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Relative clauses can be **defining/restrictive** (essential to the meaning) or **non-defining/non-restrictive** (extra information, usually with commas).  
│   │           ├── **Prepositional Phrases**:
│   │           │   - Phrases starting with a preposition that describe **location, time, cause, purpose, or relation**.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The book on the table belongs to Sarah.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man with the hat is my uncle.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Prepositional phrases as post-modifiers always **follow the noun they modify**.  
│   │           ├── **Non-finite Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses with verbs in **-ing (gerund/participle), -ed (past participle), or infinitive (to + verb)** forms.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* (Present participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *The letter written by her was beautiful.* (Past participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *He is the person to ask for help.* (Infinitive)  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Non-finite clauses are **concise alternatives** to relative clauses and often avoid repeating pronouns (*who, which*).  
│   │           ├── **Other Post-modifiers** (optional extensions for exams):
│   │           │   - **Appositive phrases**: Renames or explains the noun.  
│   │           │     - Example: *My friend, a talented musician, won the competition.*  
│   │           │   - **Adjective phrases after noun** (less common, for emphasis): *something useful, nothing important*  
│   │           └── **General Exam Tips**:
│   │               - Post-modifiers **always follow the noun**, unlike pre-modifiers.  
│   │               - Multiple post-modifiers can be combined:  
│   │                 - *The book on the table that I bought yesterday is mine.*  
│   │               - Non-finite clauses can replace relative clauses for conciseness:  
│   │                 - *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* = *The man who is standing near the gate is my friend.*
