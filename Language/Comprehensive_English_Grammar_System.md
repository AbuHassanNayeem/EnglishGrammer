## 🧱 LEVEL 2 — MORPHOLOGY (Word Structure)

The internal structure of words, their forms, and class membership

```md
## **MORPHOLOGY**
│   **Definition**: Smallest meaningful units of language

│   ├── **Free Morphemes**
│   │   │ **Definition**: Can occur independently as words
│   │   └── Examples: book, run, happy
│   │
│   └── **Bound Morphemes**
│       │ **Definition**: Must attach to another morpheme
│       │ Examples: -s, un-, -ly, -ed
│       │
│       ├── **Inflectional Morphemes**
│       │   │ **Function**: Express grammatical information
│       │   │               Do NOT change word class
│       │   └── Examples: -s, -ed, -ing, -er, -est
│       │
│       └── **Derivational Morphemes**
│           │ **Function**: Create new words
│           │               May change meaning and/or word class
│           └── Examples: un-, -ness, -ment, -ly
│
├── **INFLECTION** (Grammatical morphology)
│   │ **Definition**: Variation of word form for grammar
│   │
│   ├── **Tense**: (e.g., *walk* → *walked*)
│   │   
│   ├── **Number**: (e.g., *cat* → *cats*)
│   │
│   ├── **Person**: (e.g., *I go vs She goes*)
│   │
│   ├── **Comparison**: (e.g., *fast* → *faster* → *fastest*)
│   │
│   └── **Case**: (e.g., *he* → *him* → *his*)
│
│   **EXAM NOTE**:
│   → Inflection NEVER creates a new dictionary entry
│
├── **DERIVATION** (Lexical morphology)
│   │ **Definition**: Word formation via affixes or shift
│   │
│   ├── **Category-Changing Derivation**
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Noun → Adjective**
│   │   │   └── beauty → beautiful
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Verb → Noun**
│   │   │   └── create → creation
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Adjective → Adverb**
│   │   │   └── quick → quickly
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Zero Derivation (Conversion)**
│   │       └── butter (N) → to butter (V)
│   │
│   **EXAM NOTE**:
│   → Derivation often signals WORD CLASS change

│       │
│       ├── **Determiners (Det)**
│       │   ├── **Definition**: 
│       │   │   Words placed before nouns to clarify reference, quantity, possession, or definiteness. 
│       │   │   Determiners are essential in forming noun phrases and specify **which** or **how many** of something is being referred to.  
│       │   ├── **Functions**: 
│       │   │   - Specify **definiteness/indefiniteness** (*the book* vs *a book*).  
│       │   │   - Indicate **quantity or amount** (*few students, many ideas*).  
│       │   │   - Show **possession or association** (*my house, her book*).  
│       │   │   - Point to **specific entities** (*this pen, those books*).  
│       │   │   - Introduce **numbers or order** (*first prize, three apples*).  
│       │   └── **Types of Determiners**:
│       │       ├── **Articles**:
│       │       │   - **Definite Article**: *the* → refers to a specific entity.  
│       │       │     - Example: *The dog barked loudly.*  
│       │       │   - **Indefinite Articles**: *a, an* → refers to a non-specific entity.  
│       │       │     - Example: *I saw a cat in the garden.*  
│       │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Use *a* before consonant sounds, *an* before vowel sounds (*a university, an apple*).  
│       │       ├── **Demonstratives**:
│       │       │   - Words that indicate **proximity or distance**: *this, that, these, those*.  
│       │       │   - Example: *This book is mine. Those chairs are old.*  
│       │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Singular vs plural → *this/that* (singular), *these/those* (plural).  
│       │       ├── **Quantifiers**:
│       │       │   - Express **quantity or amount** of nouns: *some, any, every, no, few, many, much, most, all, half, both, either, neither, each, one, another, others*.  
│       │       │   - Examples:  
│       │       │     - *Few students passed the exam.*  
│       │       │     - *All the cookies are gone.*  
│       │       │     - *Each child received a gift.*  
│       │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Some quantifiers work with **countable nouns** (*few, many*), others with **uncountable nouns** (*little, much*).  
│       │       ├── **Numbers**:
│       │       │   - Cardinal numbers: *one, two, three…* (indicate quantity)  
│       │       │   - Ordinal numbers: *first, second, third…* (indicate position/order)  
│       │       │   - Examples: *I have three books. She won first prize.*  
│       │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Numbers as determiners always precede nouns (*three apples*, not *apples three*).  
│       │       ├── **Possessives**:
│       │       │   - Show **ownership or relationship**: *my, your, his, her, its, our, their, whose*.  
│       │       │   - Examples: *Her dress is beautiful. Whose bag is this?*  
│       │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Possessive determiners must match the **owner** and are followed by the noun (*my book*, not *mine book*).  
│       │       ├── **Interrogative Determiners**:
│       │       │   - Used to ask questions: *which, what, whose*.  
│       │       │   - Example: *Which color do you prefer? Whose bag is this?*  
│       │       ├── **Distributive Determiners**:
│       │       │   - Show distribution or individuality: *each, every, either, neither*.  
│       │       │   - Example: *Each student must submit homework. Neither option is suitable.*  
│       │       └── **Exam Tips (General)**:
│       │           - Determiners always appear **before adjectives (if any) and nouns**: *the red car*, *my best friend*.  
│       │           - Most determiners **cannot be used together**: *the my book ❌*, *some few books ❌*.  
│       │           - Count vs uncount nouns affect choice of determiners: *many books (countable), much water (uncountable)*.  
│       │
│       │
│       ├── **Pronoun**
│       │   │ **Function**: Replace noun phrases
│       │   │ **Morphology**: case (he/him)
│       │   └── he, she, they
│       │        ├── **Personal Pronouns**
│       │        │   ├── **Subjective (Nominative Case)**: (*I, We, You, He, She, It, They*)
│       │        │   ├── **Objective (Accusative Case)**: (*Me, Us, You, Him, Her, It, Them*)
│       │        │   └── **Possessive Personal Pronouns**
│       │        │       ├── **Possessive Adjectives (Determiners)**: (*My, Our, Your, His, Her, Its, Their*)
│       │        │       └── **Possessive Pronouns (Absolute)**: (*Mine, Ours, Yours, His, Hers, Its, Theirs*)
│       │        │
│       │        ├── **Reflexive Pronouns**: (*Myself, Yourself, Himself, Herself, Itself, Ourselves, Yourselves, Themselves, Oneself*)
│       │        ├── **Emphatic (Intensive)**: (*Same forms as Reflexive; Myself, Himself, Themselves, etc.*)
│       │        ├── **Difference between Reflexive and Emphatic**:
│       │        │   ├── **Reflexive**: Object refers back to subject; REQUIRED for meaning.
│       │        │   │   └── Example: *I hurt **myself**.* (Cannot say: *I hurt.* — incomplete)
│       │        │   ├── **Emphatic**: Adds emphasis; OPTIONAL and removable.
│       │        │   │   └── Example: *I **myself** did it.* (Can say: *I did it.* — still complete)
│       │        │   └── **Exam Tip**: Remove the pronoun—if sentence is incomplete, it's reflexive; if complete, it's emphatic.
│       │        ├── **Demonstrative**: (*This, That, These, Those, Such, The same*)
│       │        ├── **Interrogative**: (*Who, Whom, Whose, Which, What, Whoever, Whichever, Whatever*)
│       │        ├── **Relative**: (*Who, Whom, Whose, Which, That, Whoever, Whomever, Whichever, Whatever, As, But*)
│       │        ├── **Difference between Interrogative and Relative**:
│       │        │   ├── **Interrogative**: Asks a question; stands alone.
│       │        │   │   └── Example: ***Who** arrived?* / ***Which** book did you read?*
│       │        │   ├── **Relative**: Introduces a clause; connects to a noun (antecedent).
│       │        │   │   └── Example: *The man **who** arrived is my teacher.* / *The book **which** I read was great.*
│       │        │   └── **Exam Tip**: If the pronoun asks a question → Interrogative. If it introduces a clause describing a noun → Relative.
│       │        ├── **Who vs Whom** (Exam Essential):
│       │        │   ├── **Who**: Subject position (*Who arrived?* → *He arrived* ✓)
│       │        │   ├── **Whom**: Object position (*Whom did you see?* → *I saw him* ✓)
│       │        │   └── **Trick**: Substitute he/him. *He* → *who*; *Him* → *whom*.
│       │        ├── **Indefinite Pronouns**
│       │        │   ├── **Universal**: (*All, Both, Each, Every, Everyone, Everybody, Everything*)
│       │        │   ├── **Distributive**: (*Each, Either, Neither*)
│       │        │   ├── **Quantitative**: (*Some, Any, Much, Many, Few, Little, Several, Enough, More, Most, Both*)
│       │        │   ├── **Negative**: (*None, Nobody, Nothing, No one, Neither*)
│       │        │   └── **Existential**: (*Someone, Somebody, Something, Anyone, Anybody, Anything*)
│       │        ├── **Reciprocal**: (*Each other, One another*)
│       │        ├── **Dummy / Expletive**: (*It, There*)
│       │        └── **Pronoun Case in Coordinate Structures** (Exam Trap):
│       │            ├── Both pronouns must be same case.
│       │            ├── Subject: *She **and I** went home.* ✓ (NOT: *Her and me went home.* ❌)
│       │            ├── Object: *They invited **him and me**.* ✓ (NOT: *They invited he and I.* ❌)
│       │            └── **Trick**: Remove the other person—would you say "I went" or "Me went"?
│       │
│       │
│       ├── **Preposition**
│       │   │ **Function**: Express relation

│       │   │
│       │   ├── **Correlative** (Paired Conjunctions)
│       │   │   ├── *either...or* (choice between two)

│       │   │   │   └── Example: *Whether you win **or** lose, play fair.*
│       │   │   └── **Exam Tips**:
│       │   │       - **Parallel structure required**: Both parts must be grammatically equal.
│       │   │       - **Subject-verb agreement**: With *neither...nor* and *either...or*, verb agrees with CLOSER subject.
│       │   │       - Example: *Neither the students **nor** the teacher **was** present.* ✓
│       │   │

### **3. SYNTAX (Sentence Structure)**
│
├── **3.1 Sentence**
│   ├── **Definition**: A complete grammatical unit expressing a full thought.
│   ├── **Internal Structure**: Clause → Phrase → Word
│   ├── **Types CLASSIFICATION**: Simple / Compound / Complex / Compound-Complex
│   └── **Sentence Force**: Declarative / Interrogative / Imperative / Optative / Exclamative
│
├── **3.1.1 Internal Structure: Clause**
│   ├── **Definition**: A grammatical unit containing a Subject and a Predicate.
│   │
│   ├── **3.1.1.1 Clause Types by Independence**
│   │   ├── **3.1.1.1.1 Independent (Main Clause)**
│   │   │   └── Can stand alone as a complete sentence.
│   │   │       - Example: *She studies hard.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **3.1.1.1.2 Dependent (Subordinate Clause)**
│   │       ├── Cannot stand alone; must be attached to a main clause.
│   │       ├── **Noun Clause** (Acts as noun: subject, object, complement)
│   │       │   - Example: *What he said* is important. / *I know that she is coming.*
│   │       ├── **Adjective (Relative) Clause** (Modifies a noun)
│   │       │   - Example: *The book that I read* was excellent.
│   │       └── **Adverbial Clause** (Modifies a verb, adjective, or adverb)
│   │           - Example: *She succeeded because she worked hard.*
│   │
│   ├── **3.1.1.2 Clause Types by Verb Form**
│   │   ├── **3.1.1.2.1 Finite Clause**
│   │   │   └── Contains a finite verb (marked for tense and agreement).
│   │   │       - Example: *He goes to school.* / *She was sleeping.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **3.1.1.2.2 Non-finite Clause**
│   │       ├── Contains a non-finite verb (not marked for tense).
│   │       ├── **To-infinitive**
│   │       │   - Form: *to + base verb* (e.g., *to walk, to study*)
│   │       │   - Example: *To succeed is important.* / *I want to go.*
│   │       │
│   │       ├── **Infinitive Phrase / Infinitival Clause**
│   │       │   ├── **Infinitive Phrase (INF-PHRASE)**
│   │       │   │   ├── **Structure**: *To + Verb* (no explicit internal subject)
│   │       │   │   ├── **Example**: 
│   │       │   │   │   - "*To learn* is important."
│   │       │   │   │   - "To learn" acts as the **subject** of the sentence.
│   │       │   │   │   - No explicit subject inside the infinitive.
│   │       │   │   └── **Exam Tip**: 
│   │       │   │       - Singular verb agreement (*To read books is fun*).
│   │       │   │       - Avoid plural verb with infinitive subject: *To read books are fun.* ❌
│   │       │   │       - Think of INF-PHRASE as a **simpler noun-like structure**
│   │       │   │
│   │       │   └── **Infinitival Clause (INF-CLAUSE)**
│   │       │       ├── **Structure**: *Subject + To + Verb* (explicit subject)
│   │       │       ├── **Subject (NP)**
│   │       │       │   └── **Pronoun** (*him*)
│   │       │       ├── **To + Verb** (*to learn*)
│   │       │       ├── **Example**: 
│   │       │       │   - "*For him to learn* is important."
│   │       │       │   - "For him to learn is important."
│   │       │       │   - "him" is the explicit subject of the infinitival clause.
│   │       │       │   - The clause as a whole functions as the **subject** of the sentence.
│   │       │       ├── **Key Point**: Acts as an embedded mini-sentence.
│   │       │       └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │       │           - Usually starts with *for + pronoun*.
│   │       │           - Think of INF-CLAUSE as a *mini-sentence embedded* in the main sentence.
│   │       │
│   │       ├── **That-Clause / Finite Nominal Clause**: (*That he failed is sad*)
│   │       │   ├── **1. That-Clause**
│   │       │   │   ├── **Definition**: Subordinate clause introduced by "that"
│   │       │   │   ├── **Function**: Can act as noun, adjective, or adverb
│   │       │   │   ├── **Verb Type**: Usually finite (tense-marked)
│   │       │   │   ├── **Key Point**: "That" is explicitly present (optional in informal speech)
│   │       │   │   ├── **Examples**
│   │       │   │   │   ├── I know that she is coming. (object of "know")
│   │       │   │   │   └── It is clear that he made a mistake. (subject complement)
│   │       │   │   └── **Note**: Often overlaps with finite nominal clauses
│   │       │   │
│   │       │   ├── **2. Finite Nominal Clause**
│   │       │   │   ├── **Definition**: Clause that behaves like a noun (subject, object, or complement)
│   │       │   │   ├── **Verb Type**: Always finite (tense-marked, agrees with subject)
│   │       │   │   ├── **Introducer**: May or may not begin with "that"
│   │       │   │   ├── **Examples**
│   │       │   │   │   ├── That she is coming is obvious. (subject)
│   │       │   │   │   ├── I think he is honest. (object)
│   │       │   │   │   └── It seems that they have left. (subject complement)
│   │       │   │   └── **Exam Tip**: Acts like a noun → finite nominal clause
│   │       │   │
│   │       │   ├── **Key Differences**
│   │       │   │   ├── **Introducer**
│   │       │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Must use "that" (optional in informal speech)
│   │       │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: May or may not use "that"
│   │       │   │   ├── **Verb Type**
│   │       │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Usually finite
│   │       │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: Always finite
│   │       │   │   ├── **Function**
│   │       │   │   │   ├── That-Clause: Any clause type (noun, adj, adv)
│   │       │   │   │   └── Finite Nominal Clause: Always functions as a noun
│   │       │   │   └── **Examples**
│   │       │   │       ├── That-Clause: I know that he is right.
│   │       │   │       └── Finite Nominal Clause: That he is right is obvious.
│   │       │   │
│   │       │   └── **Quick Tip / Exam Tip**
│   │       │       ├── If it acts like a noun → finite nominal clause
│   │       │       ├── If it starts explicitly with "that" → that-clause
│   │       │       └── Most that-clauses are finite nominal clauses, but not all finite nominal clauses require "that"

│   │   │           - Most determiners cannot be used together (*the my book ❌*, *some few books ❌*).
│   │   │           - Count vs uncount nouns affect choice (*many books, much water*).
│   │   │           - **Intervening Phrases Trap**: Verb agrees with subject, NOT the phrase in between.
│   │   │             - *One of the girls **has** arrived.* ✓ (subject = "one")
│   │   │             - *The group of students **is** here.* ✓ (or *are* if collective plural sense)

│   │   │       │   - Relative clauses used as adjectives (pre-nominal, less common in English but possible in formal or poetic style): *the man who I met yesterday*  
│   │   │       │     - Example: *The students who studied hard passed the exam.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Degree Words (Intensifiers/Modifiers)**:
│   │   │       │   - Modify the adjective to indicate intensity, amount, or limitation.  
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *very, too, enough, so, extremely, quite, too much, too little*  
│   │   │       │   - Example sentences:  
│   │   │       │     - *She is very intelligent.*  
│   │   │       │     - *He is too tired to continue.*  
│   │   │       │     - *There is enough water for everyone.*  
│   │   │       ├── **Other Pre-modifiers** (optional extension for exams):

│   │   │       │   - **Possessives**: *my house, her idea*  
│   │   │       │   - **Quantifiers**: *many people, few options*  
│   │   │       ├── **Noun Modifiers (Attributive Nouns)**:
│   │   │       │   - Nouns used as adjectives to modify other nouns.
│   │   │       │   - Examples: *stone* wall, *gold* watch, *kitchen* table, *bus* stop, *chicken* soup.
│   │   │       │   - **Exam Tip**: Unlike adjectives, noun modifiers cannot take degree words (*very stone wall* ❌).  
│   │   │       └── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │           - Pre-modifiers **always come before the head noun**.  
│   │   │           - Multiple pre-modifiers follow this order (general rule):  
│   │   │             1. Determiner → 2. Quantifier/Number → 3. Opinion/Adjective → 4. Size/Shape → 5. Age → 6. Color → 7. Material → 8. Purpose/Qualifier → Noun  
│   │   │             - Example: *The three large old brown wooden dining tables*  
│   │   │           - Degree words usually **precede adjectives** (*very tall*, *too little water*).  
│   │   │           - Participial phrases often **describe the noun** directly (*the running horse, the broken vase*).  
│   │   │
│   │   └── **3.1.1.3.5 Post-modifiers**
│   │       ├── **Definition**: 
│   │       │   Words, phrases, or clauses that **come after the noun** to provide additional information, clarify, or describe it. 
│   │       │   Post-modifiers are part of the **noun phrase** and refine the meaning of the head noun.  
│   │       ├── **Functions**: 
│   │       │   - Give extra descriptive information about the noun.  
│   │       │   - Identify or restrict the reference of the noun.  
│   │       │   - Add precision or context.  
│   │       └── **Types of Post-modifiers**:
│   │           ├── **Relative Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses introduced by relative pronouns (*who, whom, whose, which, that*) or relative adverbs (*where, when, why*).  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man who I met yesterday is my teacher.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *I visited the town where I was born.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Relative clauses can be **defining/restrictive** (essential to the meaning) or **non-defining/non-restrictive** (extra information, usually with commas).  
│   │           ├── **Prepositional Phrases**:
│   │           │   - Phrases starting with a preposition that describe **location, time, cause, purpose, or relation**.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The book on the table belongs to Sarah.*  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man with the hat is my uncle.*  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Prepositional phrases as post-modifiers always **follow the noun they modify**.  
│   │           ├── **Non-finite Clauses**:
│   │           │   - Clauses with verbs in **-ing (gerund/participle), -ed (past participle), or infinitive (to + verb)** forms.  
│   │           │   - Example: *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* (Present participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *The letter written by her was beautiful.* (Past participle)  
│   │           │   - Example: *He is the person to ask for help.* (Infinitive)  
│   │           │   - **Exam Tip**: Non-finite clauses are **concise alternatives** to relative clauses and often avoid repeating pronouns (*who, which*).  
│   │           ├── **Other Post-modifiers** (optional extensions for exams):
│   │           │   - **Appositive phrases**: Renames or explains the noun.  
│   │           │     - Example: *My friend, a talented musician, won the competition.*  
│   │           │   - **Adjective phrases after noun** (less common, for emphasis): *something useful, nothing important*  
│   │           └── **General Exam Tips**:
│   │               - Post-modifiers **always follow the noun**, unlike pre-modifiers.  
│   │               - Multiple post-modifiers can be combined:  
│   │                 - *The book on the table that I bought yesterday is mine.*  
│   │               - Non-finite clauses can replace relative clauses for conciseness:  
│   │                 - *The man standing near the gate is my friend.* = *The man who is standing near the gate is my friend.*

│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: 
│   │   │   │   │   │   A subject that does not refer to a real entity, person, or thing. It is syntactic and required for sentence structure but has no semantic content. 
│   │   │   │   │   │   These subjects are often called "formal subjects."
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Function**: 
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Fills the subject position in sentences where no real subject exists.
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Helps maintain grammatical correctness in English, especially in sentences with weather, existential statements, or delayed subjects.
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Often paired with verbs like **be**, **seem**, **appear**, or weather verbs (**rain, snow, thunder**).

│   │   │   │   │       │   - There were many people at the event.  
│   │   │   │   │       ├── **Exam Tips**:
│   │   │   │   │       │   - Always check if *it* or *there* is filling a syntactic slot without a real entity—if yes, it’s likely a dummy subject.  
│   │   │   │   │       │   - With **there**, the verb agrees with the **noun after it**:  
│   │   │   │   │       │       - There **is** a cat.  
│   │   │   │   │       │       - There **are** cats.  
│   │   │   │   │       │   - Dummy *it* often signals **impersonal statements**, **weather**, or **distance/time**; do not confuse with referential *it* (e.g., *I found it*).  
│   │   │   │   │       │   - Useful in formal writing to start sentences smoothly before introducing the real subject:  
│   │   │   │   │       │       - *It is important to study daily.*
│   │   │   │   │       └── **Related Concepts**:

│   │   │   - The main word of a phrase (determines the phrase type).
│   │   │   - Example: In "the beautiful garden", **garden** is the head (NP).
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Modifier**

│   │   │   - Example: In "the beautiful garden", **beautiful** modifies **garden**.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Complement**
│   │   │   - Obligatory elements that complete the meaning of the head.
│   │   │   - Example: In "the destruction of the city", **of the city** complements **destruction**.
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Specifier**
│   │       - Occurs at the beginning of a phrase; determines specificity/scope.
│   │       - Example: In "the [beautiful garden]", **the** is the specifier.
│   │
│   └── **Tools**
│       ├── **Phrase Structure Rules**: Formal notation for building phrases

│   │       - Example: *She* **eats** *fruit.*
│   │
│   ├── **Variations**
│   │   ├── **Inversion**
│   │   │   - Reversal of normal word order for emphasis, questions, or formality.
│   │   │   - Example (Question): *Does she eat fruit?* (V-S-O)
│   │   │   - Example (Emphasis): *Never have I seen such beauty.* (Neg-V-S)
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **Passive Voice**
│   │   │   - Changes focus: O becomes subject, S becomes agent phrase.
│   │   │   - Active: *The teacher taught the lesson.*
│   │   │   - Passive: *The lesson was taught by the teacher.* (O-V-Agent)
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Fronting / Extraposition**
│   │       - Moving elements to sentence-initial or final positions.

│   │
│   ├── **Types**
│   │   ├── **Subject–Verb Agreement**
│   │   │   - The verb must agree with the subject in person and number.
│   │   │   - Example: *She **goes*** (3rd person singular) vs *They **go*** (3rd person plural)
│   │   │   - Example: *The cat **is** sleeping.* vs *The cats **are** sleeping.*
│   │   │
│   │   └── **Pronoun–Antecedent Agreement**
│   │       - A pronoun must agree with its antecedent (the noun it replaces).
│   │       - Example: *The girl said **she** was tired.* / *The boys said **they** were tired.*
│   │
│   └── **Exam Trap**:

## 🗣️ LEVEL 8 — PRAGMATICS & DISCOURSE
The study of language in use and context.

**DISCOURSE & PRAGMATICS**
│
├── **INFORMATION STRUCTURE**:
│   │
│   ├── **Theme–Rheme (Topic-Comment)**
│   │   ├── **Theme (Topic)**: The starting point; what the sentence is about (typically subject position).
│   │   │   - Example: *She worked hard.* (Theme = "She")
│   │   └── **Rheme (Comment)**: The new information provided about the theme.
│   │       - Example: *She worked hard.* (Rheme = "worked hard")
│   │
│   ├── **Given vs New Information**
│   │   ├── **Given**: Information already known from context (typically earlier in discourse).
│   │   │   - Example: *The cat is sleeping. **The cat** (given) is old.* (new = old)
│   │   └── **New**: Information introduced for the first time (carries focus).
│   │       - Example: *What is the cat doing? The cat is **sleeping.*** (new = sleeping)
│   │
│   └── **Focus & Emphasis**
│       ├── **Focus**: The part of the sentence carrying the most important/new information.
│       │   - Example: *She didn't eat the cake.* (Neutral) vs *She ate the **cake**, not the pie.* (focused)
│       └── **Emphasis**: Highlighting certain elements through stress, intonation, or word order.
│           - Example: *It was **him** who told me.* (Cleft construction emphasizing "him")
│
├── **COHESION**: 
│   ├── **Reference / Anaphora**: (*He, This*)
│   ├── **Substitution / Ellipsis**: Removing redundant info
│   └── **Conjunction**: Logical connectors
│
├── **SPEECH ACTS**: Assertive, Directive, Commissive, Expressive, Declarative
│   ├── **Assertive**: Statement of fact or belief (*The sky is blue.* / *I think it will rain.*)
│   ├── **Directive**: Command or request (*Close the door.* / *Can you help me?*)
│   ├── **Commissive**: Promise or commitment (*I will help you.* / *I promise to arrive on time.*)
│   ├── **Expressive**: Emotion expression (*Thank you!* / *I'm sorry for your loss.*)
│   └── **Declarative**: Changes reality through utterance (*I pronounce you married.* / *You're fired!*)
│       └── **Exam Tip**: Declarative speech acts CREATE facts; Assertive speech acts DESCRIBE facts.
│
├── **IMPLICATURE**: Meaning beyond the literal words
│   ├── **Conversational Implicature**: Implied meaning from context
│   │   └── Example: *Can you pass the salt?* (Literal: ability question; Implied: request)
│   └── **Conventional Implicature**: Meaning from specific words
│       └── Example: *He is poor **but** honest.* (Implies poverty and honesty normally don't go together)
│
└── **COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE** (Grice's Maxims)
    │
    │  **Definition**: The assumption that speakers cooperate to communicate effectively.
    │
    ├── **Maxim of Quantity**
    │   ├── Say as much as is needed, but not more.
    │   └── Violation: *I have two children.* (Implies NOT three, even if true)
    │
    ├── **Maxim of Quality**
    │   ├── Say only what you believe to be true; have evidence.
    │   └── Violation: Sarcasm, irony (*What lovely weather!* during a storm)
    │
    ├── **Maxim of Relevance (Relation)**
    │   ├── Be relevant to the current topic.
    │   └── Violation: Changing subject signals unwillingness to discuss.
    │
    ├── **Maxim of Manner**
    │   ├── Be clear, brief, orderly; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.
    │   └── Violation: *Miss X produced a series of sounds...* (avoiding direct criticism)
    │
    └── **Exam Tips**:
        ├── Flouting maxims = deliberately breaking for effect (humor, politeness, implicature).
        ├── Violating maxims = unintentionally breaking (lying, confusion).
        └── Most implicature questions test Quantity ("not more than stated") and Relevance.
