GRAMMAR TOPIC: Discourse Deixis
│
├── Definition: Discourse deixis refers to expressions pointing to parts of the ongoing discourse itself (*this*, *that*, *following*); tracks text structure beyond spatial/temporal reference (Levinson 1983).
│
├── Functions/Purpose:
│ ├── Tracks *text cohesion* (links sentences/paragraphs)
│ ├── Signals *information flow* (forward/backward reference)
│ └── Manages *reader attention* (focus on preceding/next content)
│
├── Structure/Types:
│ ├── Anaphoric (backward-pointing)
│ │ ├── Pattern: *Pro/Det → preceding discourse*
│ │ ├── Examples:
│ │ │ ├── *This* idea works well. *It* succeeded before. (*It* = *This idea*)
│ │ │ ├── The plan failed. *That* was predictable.
│ │ │ └── He left early. *The previous* point matters.
│ │ └── Exam Tip: Pronoun *antecedent* must match number (IELTS cohesion)
│ ├── Cataphoric (forward-pointing)
│ │ ├── Pattern: *Pro/Det → following discourse*
│ │ ├── Examples:
│ │ │ ├── *This* will shock you: He won the lottery!
│ │ │ ├── *The following* examples prove it.
│ │ │ └── *It* was a dark night; *it* rained heavily.
│ │ └── Exam Tip: Avoid in short sentences (TOEFL fragment trap)
│ └── Advanced: Contrastive (*the former/latter*)
│     ├── *The former* is cheap; *the latter* is better.
│     ├── *Such* statements are rare.
│     └── *The aforementioned* policy failed.
│
├── Key Patterns & Word Order:
│ ├── Anaphoric: [Topic]. *It/This/That* + comment. → Rain fell. *It* flooded streets.
│ └── Cataphoric: *This/It* + colon/comma + clause. → *This* explains everything: practice.
│
├── Common Exam Traps (Memorize these!):
│ ├── ❌ "This failed. It was good." → ✅ "*It* failed. *This* was good." (logic)
│ ├── ❌ "*The next* point is important it shows X" → ✅ "*The next* point is important: *it* shows X" (punctuation)
│ └── ❌ "He left. *This* happened next." → ✅ "*This* happened next: He left." (cataphoric order)
│
└── Quick Revision Mnemonics:
    ├── **A**naphoric = **A**rrow **B**ack (*this* ← past text), **C**ataphoric = **C**ome **F**orward
    └── Discourse deixis = "*Text* points to *text*."
