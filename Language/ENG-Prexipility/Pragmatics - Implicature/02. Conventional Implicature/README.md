## Quick Reference: Main Types Summary

### 1. **Contrastive Conjunctions** → [01. Contrastive Conjunctions/](./01.%20Contrastive%20Conjunctions/)
**Definition**: Signal opposition or unexpectedness between clauses  
**Main Triggers**: but, yet, although, whereas, however, while  
**Key Property**: Cannot replace with "and" without losing contrastive meaning  
**Example**: *John is poor but happy.* → "but" signals contrast (poverty ≠ unhappiness expected)

**When to Use**:
- To highlight unexpected combinations or oppositions
- Academic writing: Use "however," "whereas," "although" for formality
- Casual speech: "but" is universal and neutral

---

### 2. **Focus-Sensitive Particles** → [02. Focus-Sensitive Particles/](./02.%20Focus-Sensitive%20Particles/)
**Definition**: Emphasize unexpectedness, restriction, or inclusion  
**Main Triggers**: even, only, just, merely, also, too  
**Key Property**: Position-sensitive (placement affects what is focused)  
**Example**: 
- *Even John passed.* (John unexpected; low likelihood)
- *Only John passed.* (John alone; exclusive)

**When to Use**:
- **even**: To signal surprise or low expectation
- **only**: To restrict to minimal/exclusive set
- **also/too**: To add to existing set (non-exclusive)

---

### 3. **Conclusive / Inferential Particles** → [03. Conclusive Inferential Particles/](./03.%20Conclusive%20Inferential%20Particles/)
**Definition**: Signal logical consequence or causal inference  
**Main Triggers**: therefore, consequently, thus, hence, so, accordingly  
**Key Property**: Requires punctuation (semicolon/period before; comma after for formal particles)  
**Example**: *It rained. Therefore, the match was canceled.* → Logical inference (rain → cancellation)

**When to Use**:
- **Formal writing**: Use "therefore," "thus," "hence," "consequently"
- **Casual speech**: Use "so"
- To link premises to conclusions in arguments

---

### 4. **Additive Particles** → [04. Additive Particles/](./04.%20Additive%20Particles/)
**Definition**: Add information or include elements in sets  
**Main Triggers**: and, also, too, moreover, furthermore, in addition, plus  
**Key Property**: Presupposes non-uniqueness (others exist)  
**Example**: 
- *John also passed.* → Presupposes others passed
- *John is smart and hardworking.* → Both traits apply

**When to Use**:
- **also/too**: To add to existing set (also = mid-sentence; too = sentence-final)
- **moreover/furthermore**: To escalate or strengthen argument (formal)
- **and**: Universal neutral addition

---

### 5. **Concessive Particles** → [05. Concessive Particles/](./05.%20Concessive%20Particles/)
**Definition**: Signal concession or expectation override  
**Main Triggers**: still, nevertheless, nonetheless, yet, even so, all the same  
**Key Property**: Acknowledges obstacle but asserts outcome persists  
**Example**: *It rained. Still, they went out.* → Despite rain (obstacle), went out (unexpected persistence)

**When to Use**:
- **Formal writing**: Use "nevertheless," "nonetheless"
- **Neutral contexts**: Use "still," "yet," "even so"
- **Casual speech**: Use "all the same"
- To acknowledge counterpoints while maintaining position

---

### 6. **Evaluative / Attitudinal Particles** → [06. Evaluative Attitudinal Particles/](./06.%20Evaluative%20Attitudinal%20Particles/)
**Definition**: Express speaker's attitude or evaluation  
**Main Triggers**: luckily, unfortunately, frankly, obviously, surprisingly, naturally, wisely, foolishly  
**Key Property**: Truth-independent (doesn't change propositional truth)  
**Example**: *Luckily, the train arrived on time.* → Positive evaluation (relief) added to fact

**When to Use**:
- **Positive evaluation**: luckily, fortunately, wisely, naturally
- **Negative evaluation**: unfortunately, unluckily, foolishly, regrettably, sadly
- **Candor**: frankly, honestly (for uncomfortable truths)
- **Certainty**: obviously, clearly (for self-evident claims)
- **Surprise**: surprisingly, unexpectedly (for violated expectations)

---

## Cross-Type Comparisons

### **Contrastive vs. Concessive**
├── **Both** signal unexpected relationships
├── **Contrastive**: Emphasizes opposition (*John is poor but happy.*)
└── **Concessive**: Emphasizes obstacle-override (*It rained. Still, they went out.*)

### **Additive vs. Focus (Also vs. Only)**
├── **Additive (also)**: Adds to set; presupposes others (*John also passed.*)
└── **Focus (only)**: Restricts to minimal set; excludes others (*Only John passed.*)

### **Conclusive vs. Additive (Therefore vs. And)**
├── **Conclusive (therefore)**: Logical inference (*It rained. Therefore, match canceled.*)
└── **Additive (and)**: Simple addition (*It rained, and it was cold.*)

### **Evaluative vs. Propositional Content**
├── **Evaluative**: Speaker's attitude (*Luckily, he arrived.*)
└── **Propositional**: Objective fact (*He arrived.*)

## Common Properties Across All Types

### **Non-Cancellability**
All conventional implicatures are **non-cancellable**:
- ❌ *John is poor but happy, but I don't mean to imply contrast.* (contradictory)
- ❌ *Only John passed, but others passed too.* (contradictory)
- ❌ *Luckily, he survived, but I don't think it's lucky.* (contradictory)

### **Context-Independence**
Meaning is **lexically fixed**, not derived from context:
- "But" always signals contrast (not context-dependent)
- "Only" always restricts (not cancellable by context)
- "Luckily" always conveys positive evaluation (not negotiable)

### **Truth-Preserving**
Conventional implicatures **don't affect truth conditions**:
- *John is poor but happy.* → Truth of "John is happy" unchanged by "but"
- *Only John passed.* → Truth of "John passed" unchanged by "only"
- *Luckily, the train arrived on time.* → Truth of arrival unchanged by "luckily"

## Exam Strategy Guide

### **SSC / BCS Focus Areas**
1. **Substitution errors**: but ≠ and, only ≠ also
2. **Punctuation**: Comma placement with conclusive/concessive particles
3. **Verb agreement**: *Only John passes* (not "pass")

### **IELTS / TOEFL Focus Areas**
1. **Formality matching**: Use formal particles in essays (therefore, nevertheless, moreover)
2. **Avoid informal in writing**: Don't use "so," "plus," "all the same" in academic essays
3. **Vocabulary range**: Diversify particles to demonstrate proficiency

### **GRE / GMAT Focus Areas**
1. **Logical reasoning**: Understand premise-conclusion links (conclusive particles)
2. **Scalar entailment**: "Even" creates downward entailment
3. **Exclusive vs. additive**: "Only" excludes; "also" includes

## Mnemonic for All Six Types

**COFFEE** (Conventional Implicature Types)
- **C**ontrastive (but, yet, however)
- **O**nly & focus-sensitive (only, even, just)
- **F**urthermore & additive (and, also, moreover)
- **F**ortunately & evaluative (luckily, unfortunately, wisely)
- **E**ven so & concessive (still, nevertheless, yet)
- **E**rgo & conclusive (therefore, thus, hence)

## Master Checklist

Before exams, ensure you can:
- [ ] Identify all six types of conventional implicature triggers
- [ ] Explain why each type is non-cancellable
- [ ] Apply correct punctuation for conclusive/concessive particles
- [ ] Position focus-sensitive particles correctly
- [ ] Match formality level to context (formal vs. informal particles)
- [ ] Distinguish evaluative particles from propositional content
- [ ] Recognize presuppositions (additive particles presuppose others)
- [ ] Transform between particles while maintaining core meaning
