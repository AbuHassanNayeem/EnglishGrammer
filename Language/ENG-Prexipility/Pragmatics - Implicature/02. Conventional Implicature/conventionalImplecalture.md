# 📦 CONVENTIONAL IMPLICATURES: Complete Integrated Taxonomy

## Overview
This taxonomy integrates theoretical classifications with comprehensive linguistic examples, providing both structural organization and practical application of conventional implicatures (CI).

---

## 📂 **PART I: CORE CI (Multidimensional Meaning)**

### **1. Expressives & Attitudinal Language**

#### **1.1 Expressive Adjectives**
- **Markers**: damn, bloody, freaking, goddamn, fucking
- **Function**: Express speaker's emotional intensity without affecting truth conditions
- **Example**: "That damn dog barked all night" (truth conditions = dog barked; CI = speaker's annoyance)
- **Properties**: Non-displaceability, speaker-oriented, multidimensional meaning
- **Test**: Cannot be denied: *"That damn dog barked, but I'm not annoyed" is contradictory

#### **1.2 Epithets & Evaluative Terms**
- **Markers**: bastard, jerk, idiot, genius (ironic), angel, saint
- **Function**: Convey speaker's attitude toward referent
- **Example**: "That bastard stole my idea" (at-issue = X stole; CI = speaker's negative evaluation)
- **Social dimension**: Can encode power relations, in-group/out-group status
- **Reclamation**: Some terms undergo reappropriation by targeted groups

#### **1.3 Diminutives & Augmentatives**
- **Morphological markers**: -let, -ie/-y, -ling, -ette
- **Lexical markers**: little, tiny, great, grand
- **Function**: Express size + affection/condescension
- **Examples**:
  - "My little project" (affection or belittling depending on context)
  - "booklet" (small + sometimes cute/unimportant)
  - "grand plan" (impressive + potentially ironic)
- **Cross-linguistic**: Spanish -ito/-ita, Italian -ino/-ina, German -chen/-lein

#### **1.4 Interjections & Exclamatives**
- **Markers**: alas, hooray, ouch, wow, damn, phew, yikes, ugh
- **Function**: Express immediate emotional reactions
- **Example**: "Alas, he never returned" (at-issue = didn't return; CI = speaker's sorrow)
- **Properties**: Performative, emotionally deictic, often prosodically marked
- **Discourse function**: Can function as standalone speech acts

---

### **2. Appositives & Supplementary Expressions**

#### **2.1 Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses**
- **Structure**: who/which clauses (comma-bounded)
- **Function**: Add backgrounded information separate from main assertion
- **Example**: "My brother, who lives in Paris, called"
  - At-issue: Brother called
  - CI: Brother lives in Paris (presupposed/backgrounded)
- **Diagnostic**: Projects under negation, questions, modals
- **Contrast with restrictive**: "My brother who lives in Paris called" (restrictive, identifies which brother)

#### **2.2 Nominal Appositives**
- **Structure**: NP, NP₂, VP
- **Function**: Provide additional identification or characterization
- **Example**: "Ed, a monster, terrorized the village"
  - At-issue: Ed terrorized village
  - CI: Ed is a monster
- **Projection**: "Ed, a monster, didn't terrorize the village" (still CI: Ed is a monster)
- **Types**: Identificational, characterizational, metalinguistic

#### **2.3 As-Appositives**
- **Structure**: NP as NP₂
- **Function**: Specify role or capacity
- **Example**: "She hired him as a consultant"

### **3. Contrastive & Adversative Markers**

#### **3.1 Basic Contrastives**
- **Markers**: but, yet, however, whereas, while, nevertheless, nonetheless
- **Function**: Signal semantic opposition + denial of expectation
- **Example**: "John is poor but happy"
  - At-issue: John is poor AND happy
  - CI: Poverty typically incompatible with happiness
- **Expectation structure**: P but Q → normally (P → ¬Q)
- **50+ examples**:
  - "She's young but wise" (youth ≠ wisdom expected)
  - "He tried but failed" (effort → success expected)
  - "It's cheap but good" (cheapness ≠ quality expected)

#### **3.2 Concessive Markers**
- **Markers**: although, though, even though, despite, in spite of, notwithstanding
- **Function**: Acknowledge obstacle but assert main clause anyway

## 📂 **PART V: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS & ADVANCED TOPICS**

### **14. Core Theoretical Issues**

#### **14.1 The Projection Problem**
- **Question**: How do CIs behave under operators (negation, questions, modals, conditionals)?
- **Key property**: CIs typically **project** (survive embedding)
- **Examples**:
  - "John didn't manage to open it" → Still implies it was difficult
  - "Did that bastard steal it?" → Still implies speaker's negative attitude
  - "If John's a bastard, he deserves it" → CI can be filtered
- **Comparison with presuppositions**: Similar projection behavior
- **Plugs and filters**: Some contexts block projection
  - Plugs: "say that", "claim that" can block
  - Filters: Conditionals can filter in antecedent position

#### **14.2 Multidimensional Semantics**
- **Core idea**: CIs operate on separate semantic dimension from at-issue content
- **Potts (2005)**: Logic of Conventional Implicatures (LCI)
  - At-issue tier: Truth-conditional content
  - CI tier: Non-truth-conditional, expressive content
- **Compositionality**: How do CIs combine with at-issue content?
- **Independence**: CI content is scopeless, speaker-oriented
- **Formal frameworks**:
  - Type-shifting: CI-bearing expressions have special types
  - Separate dimensions: Parallel semantic computation
  - Application parsetree: Mixed types compose via application

#### **14.3 CI vs. Presupposition vs. Conversational Implicature**

**DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:**

| Property | CI | Presupposition | Conversational Implicature |
|----------|-----|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Cancellability** | No | No | Yes |
| **Detachability** | Yes (lexically bound) | Yes (lexically bound) | No (content-based) |
| **Calculability** | No (conventional) | No (conventional) | Yes (from maxims) |
| **Projection** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Speaker-orientation** | Yes | No | Sometimes |
| **Truth-conditional** | No | No (but affects felicity) | No |

**Diagnostic Tests:**

1. **Hey-wait-a-minute test** (Presupposition):
   - A: "John stopped smoking."
   - B: "Hey wait a minute, I didn't know he smoked!"
   - Tests whether content is presupposed (backgrounded)

2. **Cancellability test** (Conversational Implicature):
   - "Some students passed; in fact, all of them did." ✓
   - "That damn dog barked; #but I'm not annoyed." ✗

3. **Projection test** (CI & Presupposition):
   - Embed under negation, questions, modals—does it survive?

4. **Detachability test** (CI & Presupposition):
   - Can you say the same at-issue content without the implicature by changing words?
   - "But" vs. "and": Same logical content, different CI

**Boundary cases & debates:**
- Are scalar implicatures ("some" → "not all") CIs or conversational?
- Are all presuppositions CIs? (No consensus)
- "Even": CI or presupposition? (Shows overlap in properties)

#### **14.4 Cross-Linguistic Patterns**
- **How languages encode CIs**:
  - Morphological: Affixes, particles (Japanese honorifics, German modal particles)
  - Syntactic: Word order, clause structure (appositives)
  - Lexical: Dedicated words (but, even, damn)
  - Prosodic: Intonation, stress patterns
- **Typological variation**:
  - Evidential systems: Some languages grammaticize evidentiality extensively (Turkish, Quechua)
  - Honorific systems: Varying complexity (Japanese > Korean > European languages)
  - Modal particles: Rich in German, less developed in English
- **Universals**: All languages have some CI-like meanings, but encoding strategies vary

#### **14.5 Acquisition & Processing**
- **L1 Acquisition**: Children acquire CIs later than basic semantics
  - "Only" and "even" acquired later than logical operators
  - Presuppositions emerge gradually through childhood
  - Social CIs (honorifics, slang) tied to socialization
- **Processing costs**: CIs can slow processing
  - Appositives processed separately from main content
  - Expressives trigger emotional processing
  - Presuppositions must be accommodated if not in common ground
- **Experimental findings**:
  - ERP studies: Different neural signatures for at-issue vs. CI
  - Eye-tracking: Readers pause longer at presupposition failures
  - Truth-value judgment tasks: CIs don't affect truth judgments

## 📂 **PART VI: PRACTICE & APPLICATION**

### **15. Diagnostic Tests & Exercises**

#### **15.1 Key Diagnostic Tests**

**A. Projection Test**
- Embed in negation, questions, modals, conditionals
- If meaning survives → CI or presupposition
- Example: "That bastard didn't steal it" → Negative attitude survives

**B. Cancellability Test**
- Try to explicitly cancel
- If cancellable → conversational implicature
- If contradictory → CI or presupposition

**C. Detachability Test**
- Express same at-issue content with different words
- If implicature changes → detachable (likely CI)
- If implicature persists → not detachable (likely conversational)

**D. Hey-Wait-A-Minute Test**
- Can addressee challenge background content?
- If yes → presupposition

**E. Speaker-Orientation Test**
- Is content tied to speaker's attitude/perspective?
- If yes → likely CI (especially expressives)

#### **15.2 100+ Practice Exercises**

**(Exercises would include items like:)**

**Exercise 1**: Identify the CI and at-issue content:
- "That idiot forgot the keys
