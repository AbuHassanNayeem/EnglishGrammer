## **MORPHOLOGY**
│
├── **I. Morphemes**
│   │   **Definition**: Smallest meaningful units of language that carry semantic or grammatical meaning
│   │   **Key Principle**: Morphemes are MINIMAL units—cannot be broken into smaller meaningful parts
│   │
│   ├── **A. Free Morphemes** (Independent Morphemes / Roots / Lexical Morphemes)
│   │   │   **Definition**: Can stand alone as complete words; exist independently
│   │   │   **Characteristics**: 
│   │   │   • Usually carry lexical (dictionary) meaning
│   │   │   • Can form phrases or sentences on their own
│   │   │   • Core of any word formation
│   │   │
│   │   ├── **(1) Lexical/Content Morphemes**: Carry main semantic content
│   │   │   ├── Nouns: book, tree, happiness, justice
│   │   │   ├── Verbs: run, jump, speak, think
│   │   │   ├── Adjectives: happy, blue, tall, beautiful
│   │   │   └── Adverbs: quickly, slowly, often, here
│   │   │
│   │   └── **(2) Functional Morphemes**: Grammatical function (less common as free morphemes)
│   │       ├── Articles: a, an, the
│   │       ├── Pronouns: I, you, he, she, it
│   │       ├── Prepositions: in, on, at, by
│   │       └── Conjunctions: and, but, or
│   │
│   └── **B. Bound Morphemes** (Dependent Morphemes / Affixes)
│       │ **Definition**: Cannot occur independently; must attach to another morpheme (usually a root)
│       │ **Characteristics**:
│       │ • Never stand alone as complete words
│       │ • Attached to free morphemes to modify meaning or function
│       │ • Marked with hyphens: *un-*, *-ness*, *-ing*, *-ed*, *-s*, *-ed*, *-ly*
│       │
│       ├── **1. Inflectional Morphemes** (Grammatical morphology)
│       │   │ **Definition**: Variation of word form for grammar
│       │   │ **Function**: Express grammatical information. Do NOT change word class.
│       │   │ **Key Exam Point**: Inflection NEVER creates a new dictionary entry. Inflected forms are variants of the same lexeme.
│       │   │ Examples: -s, -ed, -ing (not all forms of -ing are inflectional)
│       │   │
│       │   ├── **a. Tense**: (e.g., *walk* → *walked*)
│       │   ├── **b. Number**: (e.g., *cat* → *cats*)
│       │   └── **c. Agreement**: Verb agrees with subject person/number (e.g., *I go* vs *She goes*)
│       │
│       ├── **COMPLETE LIST OF INFLECTIONAL MORPHEMES**:
│       │   ├── **1. -s (plural)**: Marks nouns as plural
│       │   │   └── Example: *cat* → *cats*, *book* → *books*
│       │   ├── **2. -'s (possessive)**: Shows ownership or relationship
│       │   │   └── Example: *boy* → *boy's*, *Sarah* → *Sarah's*
│       │   ├── **3. -s (3rd person singular verb)**: Marks present tense 3rd person singular
│       │   │   └── Example: *walk* → *walks*, *run* → *runs*, *he/she/it goes*
│       │   ├── **4. -ed (past tense)**: Marks regular past tense verbs
│       │   │   └── Example: *walk* → *walked*, *play* → *played*, *jump* → *jumped*
│       │   ├── **5. -en (past participle)**: Marks past participle of irregular verbs
│       │   │   └── Example: *take* → *taken*, *break* → *broken*, *write* → *written*
│       │   ├── **6. -ing (progressive/gerund)**: Marks continuous/progressive forms
│       │   │   └── Example: *walk* → *walking*, *run* → *running*, *I am eating*
│       │   │   └── **Note**: Not always inflectional—can be derivational when creating nouns (*running* = noun)
│       │   ├── **7. -er (comparative adjective)**: Compares two entities
│       │   │   └── Example: *fast* → *faster*, *tall* → *taller*, *big* → *bigger*
│       │   │   └── **Note**: Technically derivational on nouns (one who runs = runner), but inflectional on adjectives
│       │   └── **8. -est (superlative adjective)**: Shows extreme/highest degree
│       │       └── Example: *fast* → *fastest*, *tall* → *tallest*, *big* → *biggest*
│       │
│       └── **2. Derivational Morphemes** (Lexical morphology)
│           │ **Definition**: Word formation via affixes or shift
│           │ **Function**: Create new words. May change meaning and/or word class
│           │ **Key Exam Point**: Derivation CREATES new dictionary entries and often signals WORD CLASS change
│           │ Examples: un-, -ness, -ment, -ly, -er (agent noun), -able
│           │
│           ├── **a. Prefixes** (Attached to beginning)

│           │   └── *Other*: re-, over-, under-, mis-
│           │       └── Examples: rebuild, overflow, underestimate, mislead
│           │
│           ├── **b. Suffixes** (Attached to end)
│           │   ├── *Create Nouns*: -ness, -ment, -tion, -sion, -ity, -er, -or, -ist, -ism, -age, -ance, -ence
│           │   │   └── Examples: happiness, achievement, creation, tension, beauty, teacher, actor, journalist, socialism, baggage, assistance, presence

│           │       └── Examples: faster, fastest, taller, tallest
│           │
│           ├── **c. Circumfixes** (Prefix + Suffix combination)
│           │   └── Examples: un-happy, in-complete, en-danger-ed
│           │
│           ├── **d. Zero Derivation (Conversion)**
│           │   └── Examples: 
│           │
│           └── **d. Category-Changing Derivation**
│               │
│               ├── **Noun → Adjective**: beauty → beautiful, care → careful
│               ├── **Verb → Noun**: create → creation, run → runner

│   │   │   ├── **I. VERB CLASSIFICATION BY FUNCTION**
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   ├── **A. TRANSITIVE VERBS** (Require Direct Object)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: Action transfers directly to object; object required for completeness

│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Common Examples**: eat, write, build, create, give, send, teach, throw, break, buy, find, hold, know, see, tell, watch
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples in Context**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *She **ate** an apple.* (apple = required object)

│   │   │   │   │   │   - *What did he write?* → *a novel* ✓ (transitive)
│   │   │   │   │   └── **Subcategory - Ditransitive**: Takes TWO objects
│   │   │   │   │       ├── Pattern: S + V + Indirect Object + Direct Object (or with preposition)

│   │   │   │   │       └── *She **gave** him a gift.* (him = IO; gift = DO) / *I **told** them the truth.* (them = IO; truth = DO)
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   ├── **B. INTRANSITIVE VERBS** (Do NOT Take Objects)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: Action completes with subject alone; object unnecessary and impossible
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Pattern**: Subject + Intransitive Verb (+ Adverbial/Prepositional Phrase)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Common Examples**: sleep, run, arrive, die, laugh, cry, sit, stand, go, come, happen, exist, appear, vanish
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples in Context**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *She **slept** peacefully.* (peacefully = adverb, NOT object)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *He **ran** quickly.* (quickly = adverb, NOT object)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *The baby **cried** loudly.* (loudly = adverb, NOT object)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Identification Test**: Cannot answer "What/Whom?"
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *What did she sleep?* ❌ (no answer = intransitive)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *What did he run?* ❌ (no answer = intransitive)
│   │   │   │   │   └── **Note**: Adverbials (how, when, where) MODIFY but are NOT objects
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   ├── **C. LINKING VERBS** (Equative/Copular Verbs)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Definition**: Connect subject to descriptive/identifying information; show identity or state
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Pattern**: Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement (Predicate Nominative/Adjective)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Common Linking Verbs**: 
│   │   │   │   │   │   - **State of Being**: be, am, is, are, was, were, being, been
│   │   │   │   │   │   - **Sensory**: appear, feel, look, seem, smell, sound, taste
│   │   │   │   │   │   - **Becoming/Remaining**: become, grow, remain, stay, turn, prove, go
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples with Predicate Adjectives**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *She **is** happy.* (happy = adjective describing subject)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *The soup **smells** delicious.* (delicious = adjective describing soup)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *He **became** famous.* (famous = adjective describing him)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples with Predicate Nominatives**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *She **is** a doctor.* (doctor = noun renaming subject)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *He **became** king.* (king = noun renaming him)
│   │   │   │   │   └── **Characteristics**: 
│   │   │   │   │       - Subject and complement refer to same entity
│   │   │   │   │       - Cannot typically be passivized (*It is been happy* ❌)
│   │   │   │   │       - No true object; subject complement is NOT an object

│   │   │   │   ├── **ACTIVE VOICE**: Subject performs the action

│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples**:

│   │   │   │   ├── **PASSIVE VOICE (BE-PASSIVE)**: Subject receives the action
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Pattern**: S + form of be + Past Participle (+ by agent)

│   │   │   │   │   │   - Agent unimportant: *He **was arrested**.* (focus on action, not police)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Formal/objective tone: *Studies **have shown** that…* (academic/scientific)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Formation by Tense**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Simple Present: *is broken* / *are broken*
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Simple Past: *was broken* / *were broken*

│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   ├── **PASSIVE VOICE (GET-PASSIVE)**: Alternative form using GET (more informal/conversational)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Pattern**: S + get + Past Participle (+ by agent)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Difference from be-passive**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - **Be-passive**: *She **was injured** in the accident.* (neutral, factual)
│   │   │   │   │   │   - **Get-passive**: *She **got injured** in the accident.* (more dynamic, something happened TO her)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **When to use get-passive**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Negative events: *He **got fired**.* / *The car **got damaged**.*
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Sudden/unexpected events: *I **got stuck** in traffic.*
│   │   │   │   │   │   - Informal/conversational: *We **got confused**.* (NOT typically used in formal academic writing)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── **Examples**:
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *They **got married** last year.* (more personal/casual than "were married")
│   │   │   │   │   │   - *He **got caught** cheating.* (emphasis on the action happening)
│   │   │   │   │   └── **Exam Tip**: Get-passive common in conversational English; be-passive in formal/academic
│   │   │   │   │
│   │   │   │   └── **PSEUDO-PASSIVE** (Looks passive but isn't)
│   │   │   │       ├── **Pattern**: S + Link Verb + Adjective (formed from past participle)
│   │   │   │       ├── **Examples**:
│   │   │   │       │   - *The book **reads** easily.* (NOT "is read easily" - book = subject, not object)
│   │   │   │       │   - *The proposal **sounds** interesting.* (NOT a true passive)
│   │   │   │       │   - *This wine **tastes** fine.* (subject evaluates, not being passivized)

│       ├── **1. Determiners (Det)**
│       │   │   **Definition**: 
│       │   │   Words placed before nouns to clarify reference, quantity, possession, or definiteness. 
│       │   │   Determiners are essential in forming noun phrases and specify **which** or **how many** of something is being referred to.  
│       │   │   **Functions**: 
│       │   │   - Specify **definiteness/indefiniteness** (*the book* vs *a book*).  
│       │   │   - Indicate **quantity or amount** (*few students, many ideas*).  
│       │   │   - Show **possession or association** (*my house, her book*).  
│       │   │   - Point to **specific entities** (*this pen, those books*).  
│       │   │   - Introduce **numbers or order** (*first prize, three apples*).  
│       │   │
│       │   ├── **a. Articles**:
│       │   │   - **Definite Article**: *the* → refers to a specific entity.  
│       │   │     - Example: *The dog barked loudly.*  
│       │   │   - **Indefinite Articles**: *a, an* → refers to a non-specific entity.  
│       │   │     - Example: *I saw a cat in the garden.*  
│       │   │   - **Exam Tip**: Use *a* before consonant sounds, *an* before vowel sounds (*a university, an apple*).  
│       │   ├── **b. Demonstratives**:
│       │   │   - Words that indicate **proximity or distance**: *this, that, these, those*.  
│       │   │   - Example: *This book is mine. Those chairs are old.*  
│       │   │   - **Exam Tip**: Singular vs plural → *this/that* (singular), *these/those* (plural).  
│       │   ├── **c. Quantifiers**:
│       │   │   - Express **quantity or amount** of nouns: *some, any, every, no, few, many, much, most, all, half, both, either, neither, each, one, another, others*.  
│       │   │   - Examples:  
│       │   │     - *Few students passed the exam.*  
│       │   │     - *All the cookies are gone.*  
│       │   │     - *Each child received a gift.*  
│       │   │   - **Exam Tip**: Some quantifiers work with **countable nouns** (*few, many*), others with **uncountable nouns** (*little, much*).  
│       │   ├── **d. Numbers**:
│       │   │   - Cardinal numbers: *one, two, three…* (indicate quantity)  
│       │   │   - Ordinal numbers: *first, second, third…* (indicate position/order)  
│       │   │   - Examples: *I have three books. She won first prize.*  
│       │   │   - **Exam Tip**: Numbers as determiners always precede nouns (*three apples*, not *apples three*).  
│       │   ├── **e. Possessives**:
│       │   │   - Show **ownership or relationship**: *my, your, his, her, its, our, their, whose*.  
│       │   │   - Examples: *Her dress is beautiful. Whose bag is this?*  
│       │   │   - **Exam Tip**: Possessive determiners must match the **owner** and are followed by the noun (*my book*, not *mine book*).  
│       │   ├── **f. Interrogative Determiners**:
│       │   │   - Used to ask questions: *which, what, whose*.  
│       │   │   - Example: *Which color do you prefer? Whose bag is this?*  
│       │   ├── **g. Distributive Determiners**:
│       │   │   - Show distribution or individuality: *each, every, either, neither*.  
│       │   │   - Example: *Each student must submit homework. Neither option is suitable.*  
│       │   └── **Exam Tips (General)**:
│       │       - Determiners always appear **before adjectives (if any) and nouns**: *the red car*, *my best friend*.  
│       │       - Most determiners **cannot be used together**: *the my book ❌*, *some few books ❌*.  
│       │       - Count vs uncount nouns affect choice of determiners: *many books (countable), much water (uncountable)*.

│       │
│       ├── **2. Pronoun**
│       │   │ **Function**: Replace noun phrases

│       │   ├── **d. Difference between Reflexive and Emphatic**:
│       │   │   ├── **(1) Reflexive**: Object refers back to subject; REQUIRED for meaning.
│       │   │   │   └── Example: *I hurt **myself**.* (Cannot say: *I hurt.* — incomplete)
│       │   │   ├── **(2) Emphatic**: Adds emphasis; OPTIONAL and removable.

│       │   ├── **h. Difference between Interrogative and Relative**:
│       │   │   ├── **(1) Interrogative**: Asks a question; stands alone.
│       │   │   │   └── Example: ***Who** arrived?* / ***Which** book did you read?*
│       │   │   ├── **(2) Relative**: Introduces a clause; connects to a noun (antecedent).
│       │   │   │   └── Example: *The man **who** arrived is my teacher.* / *The book **which** I read was great.*
│       │   │   └── **Exam Tip**: If the pronoun asks a question → Interrogative. If it introduces a clause describing a noun → Relative.
│       │   ├── **i. Who vs Whom** (Exam Essential):
│       │   │   ├── **Who**: Subject position (*Who arrived?* → *He arrived* ✓)
│       │   │   ├── **Whom**: Object position (*Whom did you see?* → *I saw him* ✓)
│       │   │   └── **Trick**: Substitute he/him. *He* → *who*; *Him* → *whom*.
│       │   ├── **j. Indefinite Pronouns**
│       │   │   ├── **(1) Universal**: (*All, Both, Each, Every, Everyone, Everybody, Everything*)

│       │   │   │   ├── ✓ *She likes either reading **or** playing games* (both gerunds)
│       │   │   │   ├── **Principle**: Coordinated elements must be grammatically parallel

    ├── **F. Acronymy** (Creating words from initials)
    │   │ **Definition**: Forming new words from the initial letters of a phrase
    │   │ **Also called**: Acronyms (if pronounced as word); Initialisms (if letters pronounced separately)
    │   │ **Increasing in modern English, especially in tech/military**
    │   │
    │   ├── **Types**:
    │   │   ├── **Acronyms** (pronounced as single words):
    │   │   │   ├── *NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)* = pronounced /ˈneɪtoʊ/

    │   │   ├── *AWOL (Absent Without Leave)* = /ˈeɪwɔl/ or spelled out
    │   │   ├── *SNAFU (Situation Normal: All Fouled Up)* = humorous military acronym
    │   │   ├── *BTW (By The Way)* = Internet/text speak
    │   │   └── *IMHO (In My Humble Opinion)* = Internet abbreviation
    │   │

    │   │   └── *These are becoming increasingly normalized*
    │   │
    │   ├── **Characteristics**:
    │   │   ├── **May lose acronym status**: *laser, scuba, radar* now often not recognized as acronyms
    │   │   ├── **Capitalization varies**: *NATO* vs *Nato* vs *nato* depending on establishment
    │   │   ├── **Pronunciation varies**: Some acronyms pronounced as words; others remain letters
    │   │   ├── **Backronyms possible**: Folk etymology creating new meanings for established acronyms
    │   │   └── **Rapid generation in tech**: New acronyms created constantly, many don't survive

    │   └── **Productivity and societal impact**:
    │       ├── **High productivity in tech and business**: Saves communication time
    │       ├── **Generational markers**: Older speakers may not recognize newer acronyms
    │       ├── **Professional vs. informal**: STEM fields vs. internet slang differ greatly in use
    │       └── **Formal registers still resistant**: Academic writing prefers spelled-out forms initially*
    │
    ├── **G. Back-formation** (Reverse derivation - removing what seems like affixes)
    │   │ **Definition**: Creating a new word by removing what appears to be a suffix/affix
    │   │ **Also called**: Metanalysis, reanalysis, reversion
    │   │ **Creates new shorter forms from longer words through misanalysis**
    │   │
    │   ├── **Mechanism**:
    │   │   ├── **Speaker assumes a suffix exists and removes it**:
    │   │   │   ├── *editor (n.) → edit (v.)*
    │   │   │   │   └── Perceived as: edit + -or (like actor, teacher)
    │   │   │   │
    │   │   ├── *television (n.) → tele + vision or televise (v.)*
    │   │   │   └── Reanalyzed from: tele- prefix
    │   │   │
    │   │   ├── *burglar (n.) → burgle (v.)*
    │   │   │   └── Perceived as: burg- + -lar (like similar -lar agent nouns)*
    │   │   │
    │   │   └── *donate (v.) → donation (n.) (though this is regular derivation)*
    │   │
    │   ├── **Common examples**:
    │   │   ├── **Early established back-formations**:
    │   │   │   ├── *babysit (verb) from baby-sitter (noun)*
    │   │   │   ├── *edit (verb) from editor (noun)*
    │   │   │   ├── *peddle (verb) from peddler (noun)*
    │   │   │   ├── *burgle (verb) from burglar (noun)*
    │   │   │   ├── *bulldoze (verb) from bulldozer (noun)*
    │   │   │   └── *These are now fully accepted*
    │   │   │
    │   │   ├── **Newer back-formations**:
    │   │   │   ├── *housekeep (verb) from housekeeper (noun)* - originally humorous
    │   │   │   ├── *beautify (verb) from beauty (noun)* - though this is also regular -ify suffixation
    │   │   │   ├── *selfie (noun) from self-ish (adjective)* - disputed
    │   │   │   └── *escalate (verb) from escalator (noun)* - productive once accepted
    │   │   │
    │   │   ├── **Contentious or recent**:
    │   │   │   ├── *surveil (verb) from surveillance (noun)* - modern, criticized by traditionalists
    │   │   │   ├── *process (used as verb: "to process an order")* - may be back-formation
    │   │   │   ├── *euthanase (verb) from euthanasia (noun)* - rare, controversial
    │   │   │   └── *These are often considered poor language choices by prescriptivists*
    │   │   │
    │   │   └── **Humorous/nonce back-formations** (single use):
    │   │       ├── *enthuse (verb) from enthusiasm (noun)* - criticized but increasingly accepted
    │   │       ├── *intuit (verb) from intuition (noun)* - now standard*
    │   │       └── *These spread in specific communities before becoming general*
    │   │
    │   ├── **Key characteristics**:
    │   │   ├── **Reanalysis of morpheme boundaries**: Speaker mistakes a noun element for a derivational suffix
    │   │   ├── **Often involves semantic shift**: *editor* (one who edits) vs. *edit* (the action)
    │   │   ├── **Frequency leads to acceptance**: *edit, burgle, babysit* are now standard
    │   │   ├── **May be resisted initially**: Traditionalists resist *enthuse, surveil, intuit*
    │   │   └── **Unpredictable**: Can't predict which words will undergo back-formation
    │   │
    │   ├── **Distinction from other processes**:
    │   │   ├── **Vs. Conversion**: Back-formation involves morphological reanalysis; conversion doesn't
    │   │   │   └── *edit* from *editor* is back-formation; *run* (noun) from *run* (verb) is conversion
    │   │   │
    │   ├── **Vs. Suffixation**: Back-formation is reverse of regular suffix addition
    │   │   │   └── Regular: *beauty → beautify* (add -ify); Back-formation would be theoretical reverse*
    │   │   │
    │   └── **Modern productivity and language change**:
    │       ├── **Growing in contemporary English**: *surveil, emote, conflate* accepted despite resistance
    │       ├── **Often first appears in technical jargon**: Doctors/scientists use verbs before public does
    │       └── **Social media amplifies new back-formations**: Spread rapidly through communities*
    │
    └── **H. Other Processes** (Less common/productive)
        │
        ├── **1. Etymology (borrowing/loanwords)**
        │   │ **Definition**: Adopting words from other languages
        │   │ **Very productive in English; ~60% of English vocabulary from non-Germanic sources**
        │   │ **Not strictly a "word formation" process but creates new words**
        │   │
        │   ├── **Major sources**:
        │   │   ├── **French**: *restaurant, café, entrepreneur, ensemble, naïve*

        │   │   └── **Other**: *safari (Swahili), entrepreneur (French), boomerang (Aboriginal)*
        │   │
        │   ├── **Loanword adaptation**:
        │   │   ├── **Phonological**: Adapted to English sound system (*mosquito /məˈskiːtoʊ/*
        │   │   ├── **Morphological**: May undergo affixation (*ski + -er = skier; sushi + suffix)*
        │   │   └── **Orthographic**: Spelling adapted to English conventions*
        │   │
        │   └── **Note**: More extensive in English than other Germanic languages due to Norman Conquest
        │
        ├── **2. Reduplication** (repeating parts of words)
        │   │ **Definition**: Repeating a word or morpheme to create new meanings
        │   │ **Rare in English; common in many Asian languages**
        │   │
        │   ├── **Full reduplication** (whole word repeated):
        │   │   ├── *bye-bye, so-so, no-no, ha-ha, yada yada*
        │   │   ├── *wishy-washy, zigzag, zigzagging*
        │   │   └── *Usually informal/childish/emphatic*
        │   │
        │   ├── **Partial reduplication** (part of word repeated):
        │   │   ├── *wishy-washy (wise + washy)*
        │   │   ├── *helter-skelter (hel + skelter)*
        │   │   ├── *zig-zag (zig + zag)*
        │   │   └── *Often with vowel variations*
        │   │
        │   └── **Note**: More productive in compounds than standalone words
        │
        └── **3. Onomatopoeia** (words imitating sounds)
            │ **Definition**: Creating words that imitate the sounds they represent
            │ **Somewhat productive in English, especially in casual/creative writing**
            │
            ├── **Examples**:
            │   ├── *buzz, hiss, whisper, crash, bang, pop, splash, sizzle*
            │   ├── *meow, woof, quack, moo, neigh, chirp*
            │   ├── *whoosh, boom, fizz, thud, ping, pong*
            │   └── *Note*: Many are imitative but not all onomatopoeia*
            │
            ├── **Productivity**:
            │   ├── **Common in children's literature**: *splash, zoom, bang*
            │   ├── **Comic book tradition**: *pow, bam, kapow (blend + onomatopoeia)*
            │   └── **Regular language**: More limited; new ones are hard to establish*
            │
            └── **Note**: Subjective; what "sounds like" X varies across languages and speakers
