✅ Uses intransitive verbs (no object needed)  
✅ Action or state is complete with subject and verb  
✅ Cannot form passive voice (no object to promote)  
✅ Can add optional adverbials without changing pattern  
✅ Simplest and most fundamental sentence structure

**Key Test:** Can the sentence stand alone with just S + V? If yes, it's Pattern 1!
