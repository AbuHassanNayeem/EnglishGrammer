## Pattern 3 vs Pattern 2 (Key Difference)

### Pattern 3: Complement = Subject
- **She is a teacher.** (She = teacher) ✓
- Complement describes/identifies the subject
- Cannot make passive

### Pattern 2: Object ≠ Subject
- **She teaches students.** (She ≠ students) ✓
- Object receives action
- Can make passive: *Students are taught by her.*

### Test: Replace verb with "="

**Pattern 3:**
- She is happy. → She = happy ✓
- He became a doctor. → He = doctor ✓

**Pattern 2:**
- She reads books. → She = books ✗ (doesn't make sense)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Using Action Verbs as Linking Verbs
- **Wrong:** She becomes the room. (becomes is not transitive here)
- **Correct:** She enters the room. (Pattern 2: S + V + O)

### ❌ Confusing Complement with Object
- **Pattern 3:** He is a teacher. (complement)
- **Pattern 2:** He teaches students. (object)

### ❌ Using Object Pronouns with "Be"
- **Wrong:** It is me. (informal)
- **Formal:** It is I. (subject pronoun as complement)
- **Common:** It's me. (accepted in informal speech)

### ❌ Adjective vs Adverb Confusion
- **Wrong:** She feels badly. (badly = adverb)
- **Correct:** She feels bad. (bad = adjective complement)
- Note: "She feels badly" would mean her sense of touch is impaired!
