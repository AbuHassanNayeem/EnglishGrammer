- **Complete:** He put the book on the table. ✓ (has both O and A)

- She put the keys in her pocket. → She put the keys. ✗ (incomplete)
- Therefore: adverbial is ESSENTIAL (Pattern 7)

vs.

- She finished the work yesterday. → She finished the work. ✓ (still complete)
- Therefore: adverbial is OPTIONAL (Pattern 2 + optional A)
