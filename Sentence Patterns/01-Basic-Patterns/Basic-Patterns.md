# Basic Sentence Patterns — Complete Guide

## Introduction

In English grammar, there are **seven fundamental sentence patterns** that form the foundation of all English sentences. These patterns are built around the relationship between five key grammatical elements:

- [**Subject (S)**](../02-Subject/Subject.md) — the person, thing, or idea performing the action or being described
- [**Predicate (P)**](../03-Predicate/Predicate.md) — the part of the sentence that provides information about the subject
- [**Verb (V)**](../04-Verbs/Verbs.md) — the action, occurrence, or state of being
- [**Object (O)**](../05-Object/Object.md) — the receiver of the action (Direct Object = DO)
- [**Indirect Object (IO)**](../05-Object/Object.md) — the recipient or beneficiary of the action
- [**Complement (C)**](../06-Complement/Complement.md) — information that completes the meaning of the subject or object
- [**Adverbial (A)**](../07-Adverbial/Adverbial.md) — additional information about time, place, manner, reason, etc.

Understanding these patterns is essential for:
- ✅ Constructing grammatically correct sentences
- ✅ Analyzing sentence structure
- ✅ Improving writing clarity and variety
- ✅ Understanding advanced grammar concepts
- ✅ Learning English as a second language

## Legend & Notation

Throughout this guide, we use the following abbreviations:

- `S` = Subject
- `P` = Predicate
- `V` = Verb
- `O` or `DO` = Direct Object
- `IO` = Indirect Object
- `C` = Complement (Subject or Object Complement)
- `A` = Adverbial

**Example:** *She gave him a book.*
- Analysis: S: She, V: gave, IO: him, DO: a book
- Pattern: S + V + IO + DO (Pattern 5)
- Predicate: gave him a book

## The Seven Basic Sentence Patterns

### Pattern 1: S + V (Subject + Verb)

**Structure:** Subject + Intransitive Verb

**Description:** This is the simplest sentence pattern. The verb is **intransitive**, meaning it does not require an object to complete its meaning. The action is complete with just the subject and verb.

**Common Intransitive Verbs:** arrive, come, die, disappear, fall, go, happen, laugh, lie, occur, rise, run, sit, sleep, sneeze, stand, wait

**Examples:**
1. Birds fly. (S: Birds, V: fly)
2. She laughed. (S: She, V: laughed)
3. The baby cried. (S: The baby, V: cried)
4. Everyone arrived. (S: Everyone, V: arrived)
5. The sun rises. (S: The sun, V: rises)
6. Students study. (S: Students, V: study)
7. Time passes. (S: Time, V: passes)
8. Flowers bloom. (S: Flowers, V: bloom)
9. The door opened. (S: The door, V: opened)
10. He disappeared. (S: He, V: disappeared)

**Variations:**
- With compound subject: *John and Mary arrived.* (S: John and Mary, V: arrived)
- With descriptive subject: *The young children played.* (S: The young children, V: played)
- With pronoun subject: *They slept.* (S: They, V: slept)

**Notes:**
- Pattern 1 sentences cannot be made passive because there is no object
- These verbs express complete actions or states without needing additional information

---

### Pattern 2: S + V + O (Subject + Verb + Object)

**Structure:** Subject + Transitive Verb + Direct Object

**Description:** This pattern uses a **transitive verb** that requires a direct object to receive the action. The object answers the question "what?" or "whom?" after the verb.

**Common Transitive Verbs:** buy, call, choose, do, drink, eat, find, get, have, help, know, like, love, make, need, read, see, take, understand, want, watch, write

**Examples:**
1. She reads books. (S: She, V: reads, O: books)
2. They play football. (S: They, V: play, O: football)
3. I love chocolate. (S: I, V: love, O: chocolate)
4. He bought a car. (S: He, V: bought, O: a car)
5. We watched the movie. (S: We, V: watched, O: the movie)
6. She understands the lesson. (S: She, V: understands, O: the lesson)
7. They need help. (S: They, V: need, O: help)
8. He drinks coffee. (S: He, V: drinks, O: coffee)
9. I admire your courage. (S: I, V: admire, O: your courage)
10. The teacher explained the grammar. (S: The teacher, V: explained, O: the grammar)

**Passive Voice Transformation:**
- Active: She reads books. → Passive: Books are read by her.
- Active: He bought a car. → Passive: A car was bought by him.

**Object Types:**
- **Noun:** *She reads books.*
- **Pronoun:** *I saw him.*
- **Noun Clause:** *I know that she is honest.* (S: I, V: know, O: that she is honest)
- **Gerund:** *He enjoys swimming.* (S: He, V: enjoys, O: swimming)
- **Infinitive:** *She wants to leave.* (S: She, V: wants, O: to leave)

📚 **[See Pattern 2 Detailed Examples →](./01b-Pattern-2-Examples.md)**

### Pattern 3: S + V + C (Subject + Verb + Complement)

**Structure:** Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement

**Description:** This pattern uses a **linking verb** (copular verb) that connects the subject to a complement. The complement identifies, describes, or renames the subject. Unlike an object, the complement refers back to the subject.

**Common Linking Verbs:** be (am, is, are, was, were), become, seem, appear, look, sound, smell, taste, feel, remain, stay, grow, turn, prove, get

**Examples:**

**With Noun Complement (Identifies):**
1. He is a teacher. (S: He, V: is, C: a teacher)
2. She became a doctor. (S: She, V: became, C: a doctor)
3. They are students. (S: They, V: are, C: students)
4. My brother is an engineer. (S: My brother, V: is, C: an engineer)
5. She remained the champion. (S: She, V: remained, C: the champion)

**With Adjective Complement (Describes):**
6. The sky looks blue. (S: The sky, V: looks, C: blue)
7. She seems happy. (S: She, V: seems, C: happy)
8. The food tastes delicious. (S: The food, V: tastes, C: delicious)
9. He feels tired. (S: He, V: feels, C: tired)
10. The situation became serious. (S: The situation, V: became, C: serious)

**With Other Complement Types:**
11. Her plan is to travel. (S: Her plan, V: is, C: to travel) — infinitive phrase
12. The problem is what to do next. (S: The problem, V: is, C: what to do next) — wh-clause

**Test for Subject Complement:** 
Can you replace the verb with "=" (equals)? If yes, it's a subject complement:
- He = a teacher ✓
- The sky = blue ✓

**Notes:**
- Pattern 3 sentences cannot typically be made passive
- The complement must agree with the subject (not grammatically, but logically)

📚 **[See Pattern 3 Detailed Examples →](./01c-Pattern-3-Examples.md)**

---

### Pattern 4: S + V + A (Subject + Verb + Adverbial)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Adverbial

**Description:** This pattern includes an **adverbial** that provides essential information about time, place, manner, frequency, or other circumstances. Some intransitive verbs require an adverbial to complete their meaning (e.g., *live, put, place, reside*).

**Adverbial Types:**
- **Place:** where the action happens
- **Time:** when the action happens
- **Manner:** how the action happens
- **Frequency:** how often the action happens

**Examples:**

**Place Adverbials:**
1. He lives in Dhaka. (S: He, V: lives, A: in Dhaka)
2. She works at the hospital. (S: She, V: works, A: at the hospital)
3. They reside abroad. (S: They, V: reside, A: abroad)
4. The keys are on the table. (S: The keys, V: are, A: on the table)
5. He waited outside. (S: He, V: waited, A: outside)

**Time Adverbials:**
6. She sleeps early. (S: She, V: sleeps, A: early)
7. The meeting starts tomorrow. (S: The meeting, V: starts, A: tomorrow)
8. They arrived yesterday. (S: They, V: arrived, A: yesterday)
9. I wake up at 6 AM. (S: I, V: wake up, A: at 6 AM)
10. He left last night. (S: He, V: left, A: last night)

**Manner Adverbials:**
11. She speaks softly. (S: She, V: speaks, A: softly)
12. He drives carefully. (S: He, V: drives, A: carefully)
13. They work hard. (S: They, V: work, A: hard)

**Frequency Adverbials:**
14. I exercise daily. (S: I, V: exercise, A: daily)
15. She visits often. (S: She, V: visits, A: often)

**Notes:**
- Some verbs like *live, reside, stay, put, place* strongly require an adverbial
- Without the adverbial, sentences feel incomplete: *He lives* (where?) vs *He lives in Dhaka* ✓

📚 **[See Pattern 4 Detailed Examples →](./01d-Pattern-4-Examples.md)**

### Pattern 5: S + V + IO + DO (Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object)

**Structure:** Subject + Ditransitive Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object

**Description:** This pattern uses a **ditransitive verb** that takes two objects: an indirect object (the recipient/beneficiary) and a direct object (the thing given/done). The indirect object typically comes before the direct object.

**Common Ditransitive Verbs:** give, send, show, tell, teach, offer, bring, buy, make, write, lend, pass, hand, pay, sell, ask, read

**Examples:**
1. She gave me a pen. (S: She, V: gave, IO: me, DO: a pen)
2. He told them a story. (S: He, V: told, IO: them, DO: a story)
3. I sent her a letter. (S: I, V: sent, IO: her, DO: a letter)
4. They bought him a gift. (S: They, V: bought, IO: him, DO: a gift)
5. She teaches us English. (S: She, V: teaches, IO: us, DO: English)
6. He showed me the way. (S: He, V: showed, IO: me, DO: the way)
7. I'll make you breakfast. (S: I, V: 'll make, IO: you, DO: breakfast)
8. She offered him a job. (S: She, V: offered, IO: him, DO: a job)
9. They lent me their car. (S: They, V: lent, IO: me, DO: their car)
10. He read the children a bedtime story. (S: He, V: read, IO: the children, DO: a bedtime story)

**Alternative Pattern with Preposition:**
Many Pattern 5 sentences can be restructured using "to" or "for":

**S + V + DO + to/for + IO:**
- She gave a pen to me.
- He told a story to them.
- They bought a gift for him.
- She teaches English to us.

**When to use "to" vs "for":**
- **"to"** — transfer or communication: give, send, tell, show, teach, lend, pass, hand
- **"for"** — benefit or creation: buy, make, cook, build, find, get

**Passive Voice Options:**
Pattern 5 can form passive in two ways:
1. IO becomes subject: *I was given a pen (by her).*
2. DO becomes subject: *A pen was given to me (by her).*

**Identification Test:**
- Ask "to whom?" or "for whom?" to find the indirect object
- Ask "what?" to find the direct object

📚 **[See Pattern 5 Detailed Examples →](./01e-Pattern-5-Examples.md)**

### Pattern 6: S + V + O + C (Subject + Verb + Object + Complement)

**Structure:** Subject + Complex-Transitive Verb + Object + Object Complement

**Description:** This pattern uses a **complex-transitive verb** that takes both a direct object and an **object complement**. The object complement describes, identifies, or renames the direct object (not the subject).

**Common Complex-Transitive Verbs:** make, elect, name, call, consider, find, keep, leave, appoint, declare, crown, believe, think, judge, prove, designate, render

**Examples:**

**With Noun Complement:**
1. They elected him president. (S: They, V: elected, O: him, C: president)
2. She named the baby Sarah. (S: She, V: named, O: the baby, C: Sarah)
3. We called her the champion. (S: We, V: called, O: her, C: the champion)
4. The board appointed him director. (S: The board, V: appointed, O: him, C: director)
5. They crowned her queen. (S: They, V: crowned, O: her, C: queen)

**With Adjective Complement:**
6. The movie made me sad. (S: The movie, V: made, O: me, C: sad)
7. She painted the room red. (S: She, V: painted, O: the room, C: red)
8. I found the test difficult. (S: I, V: found, O: the test, C: difficult)
9. They kept the house clean. (S: They, V: kept, O: the house, C: clean)
10. He left the door open. (S: He, V: left, O: the door, C: open)

**With Participle Complement:**
11. She kept me waiting. (S: She, V: kept, O: me, C: waiting)
12. I found him sleeping. (S: I, V: found, O: him, C: sleeping)
13. They got the machine working. (S: They, V: got, O: the machine, C: working)

**Test for Object Complement:**
The complement describes or identifies the object. You can often insert "as" or "to be":
- They elected him (as) president.
- The movie made me (to be) sad.
- She painted the room (to be) red.

**Passive Voice:**
- Active: They elected him president.
- Passive: He was elected president (by them).

### Pattern 7: S + V + O + A (Subject + Verb + Object + Adverbial)

**Structure:** Subject + Transitive Verb + Object + Adverbial

**Description:** This pattern includes a transitive verb with a direct object, followed by an **adverbial** that provides essential information. Some verbs require an adverbial to complete the meaning (e.g., *put, place, set, lay*).

**Common Verbs Requiring Adverbial:** put, place, set, lay, keep, leave, find

**Examples:**

**With Place Adverbials:**
1. He put the book on the table. (S: He, V: put, O: the book, A: on the table)
2. She kept the baby in the bed. (S: She, V: kept, O: the baby, A: in the bed)
3. I placed the vase on the shelf. (S: I, V: placed, O: the vase, A: on the shelf)
4. They found him at home. (S: They, V: found, O: him, A: at home)
5. He set the cup down. (S: He, V: set, O: the cup, A: down)
6. She laid the baby in the crib. (S: She, V: laid, O: the baby, A: in the crib)
7. I left my keys in the car. (S: I, V: left, O: my keys, A: in the car)
8. He threw the ball over the fence. (S: He, V: threw, O: the ball, A: over the fence)

**With Time Adverbials:**
9. They finished the work yesterday. (S: They, V: finished, O: the work, A: yesterday)
10. She sent the email this morning. (S: She, V: sent, O: the email, A: this morning)

**With Manner Adverbials:**
11. He explained the concept clearly. (S: He, V: explained, O: the concept, A: clearly)
12. She sang the song beautifully. (S: She, V: sang, O: the song, A: beautifully)

**Notes:**
- Verbs like *put, place, set, lay* are incomplete without an adverbial
- Without the adverbial: *He put the book* (where?) — feels incomplete
- With the adverbial: *He put the book on the table* ✓

## Pattern Comparison & Identification

### How to Identify the Pattern

**Step 1:** Find the verb
**Step 2:** Identify the subject (who/what performs the action)
**Step 3:** Check what follows the verb:
- Nothing essential? → Pattern 1 (S + V)
- One noun/pronoun receiving action? → Pattern 2 (S + V + O)
- Describes/identifies subject? → Pattern 3 (S + V + C)
- Place/time/manner info? → Pattern 4 or 7 (S + V + A or S + V + O + A)
- Two objects (recipient + thing)? → Pattern 5 (S + V + IO + DO)
- Object + description of object? → Pattern 6 (S + V + O + C)

### Common Confusions

**Pattern 2 vs Pattern 3:**
- Pattern 2: Object receives action (*She reads books.* — books ≠ she)
- Pattern 3: Complement = subject (*She is a teacher.* — she = teacher)

**Pattern 4 vs Pattern 7:**
- Pattern 4: No object, just adverbial (*He lives in Dhaka.*)
- Pattern 7: Object + adverbial (*He put the book on the table.*)

**Pattern 5 vs Pattern 6:**
- Pattern 5: Two objects (*She gave me a pen.* — me and pen are different things)
- Pattern 6: Object + complement (*They elected him president.* — him = president)

---

## Expanded Patterns & Variations

### Adding Optional Elements

All seven patterns can be expanded with **optional adverbials** without changing the basic pattern:

**Pattern 1 + Optional A:**
- Birds fly. → Birds fly in the sky every morning.

**Pattern 2 + Optional A:**
- She reads books. → She reads books in the library every day.

**Pattern 3 + Optional A:**
- He is a teacher. → He is a teacher at the local school.

### Multiple Adverbials

Sentences can have multiple adverbials:
- She reads books (O) **in the library** (place) **every day** (time) **with great interest** (manner).
- Pattern: S + V + O + A + A + A

### Complex Subjects and Objects

**Complex Subject:**
- *The young boy with the red hat* ran quickly. (S: The young boy with the red hat)

**Complex Object:**
- She read *the book that I recommended*. (O: the book that I recommended)

## Subject Position Variations: Inversion

While the seven basic patterns show standard word order (Subject + Verb...), English allows **inversion** where the subject appears after the verb. This doesn't create new patterns but varies the existing ones.

### Types of Inversion

#### 1. Locative Inversion (Adverbial/Verb before Subject)

The verb or adverbial phrase appears before the subject for emphasis or style.

**Examples:**
- Here comes the bus. (A: Here, V: comes, S: the bus)
  - Normal: The bus comes here.
- Down fell the leaves. (A: Down, V: fell, S: the leaves)
  - Normal: The leaves fell down.
- There goes your chance. (A: There, V: goes, S: your chance)
  - Normal: Your chance goes there.

**Common Trigger Words:** here, there, down, up, in, out, away, off, back

#### 2. Existential "There" / "Here"

Introductory "there" or "here" precedes the verb; the logical subject follows.

**Examples:**
- There is a cat on the roof. (Expletive: there, V: is, S: a cat, A: on the roof)
- Here comes my friend. (A: here, V: comes, S: my friend)
- There lived a king. (Expletive: there, V: lived, S: a king)

#### 3. Interrogative Inversion (Questions)

In questions, the auxiliary or modal comes before the subject.

**Examples:**
- Are you ready? (Aux: Are, S: you, C: ready)
  - Statement: You are ready.
- Can he drive? (Aux: Can, S: he, V: drive)
  - Statement: He can drive.
- Did she leave? (Aux: Did, S: she, V: leave)
  - Statement: She left.

#### 4. Conditional/Literary Inversion

Formal or literary English replaces "if" clauses with inversion.

**Examples:**
- Had I known, I would have helped.
  - Normal: If I had known, I would have helped.
- Were she here, we could start.
  - Normal: If she were here, we could start.
- Should you need help, call me.
  - Normal: If you should need help, call me.

#### 5. Negative Adverbial Inversion

When negative adverbials start a sentence, inversion follows for emphasis.

**Examples:**
- Never have I seen such beauty.
  - Normal: I have never seen such beauty.
- Seldom does he arrive on time.
  - Normal: He seldom arrives on time.
- Not only did she pass, but she also got the highest score.
  - Normal: She not only passed, but also got the highest score.

### Inversion Comparison Table

| Type | Example | Subject Position | Usage |
|------|---------|------------------|-------|
| Normal | He runs fast. | Beginning (before verb) | Standard declarative |
| Locative | Here comes the train. | After verb | Emphasis, direction |
| Existential | There is a problem. | After verb | Introduction, existence |
| Interrogative | Are you tired? | After auxiliary | Questions |
| Conditional | Had I known... | After auxiliary | Formal conditionals |
| Negative | Never have I seen... | After auxiliary | Emphasis, literary |
