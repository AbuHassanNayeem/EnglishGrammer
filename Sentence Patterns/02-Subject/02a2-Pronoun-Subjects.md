# Pronoun Subjects — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
A **Pronoun Subject** is a word that substitutes for a noun phrase to avoid repetition. When a pronoun functions as the subject, it must be in the **Subjective Case** (also called Nominative Case).

## 2. Personal Pronouns (Subjective Case)

| Person | Singular | Plural | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1st** | **I** | **We** | Speaker |
| **2nd** | **You** | **You** | Listener |
| **3rd** | **He / She / It** | **They** | Topic |

### The "Me and..." Error
*   ❌ **Me and him** went home.
*   ✅ **He and I** went home.
*   *Tip:* Remove the partner. You wouldn't say "Me went," so you shouldn't say "Me and him went."

Point to specific things.
*   ***This** is mine.* / ***Those** are expensive.*

### C. Relative Pronouns
Used as subjects within a dependent clause.
