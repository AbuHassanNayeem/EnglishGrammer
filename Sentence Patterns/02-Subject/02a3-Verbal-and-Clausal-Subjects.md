# Verbal & Clausal Subjects — Detailed Guide

## 1. Overview
Sometimes a subject is not a simple person or thing, but an **Action** or an entire **Idea**. English uses Gerunds, Infinitives, and Clauses to turn these complex concepts into subjects.

## 2. Verbal Subjects (Gerunds & Infinitives)

### A. Gerund Subjects (V-ing)
The most common way to make an action a subject. It treats the activity as a concept.
*   **Formula:** Verb + ing (+ object/adverb)
*   ***Swimming*** *is fun.*
*   ***Reading books quickly*** *is a skill.*
*   **Agreement:** Always **Singular**. (*Reading books **is**...*)

### B. Infinitive Subjects (To + Verb)
Expresses purpose, potential, or abstract philosophy. Often sounds formal or poetic.
*   ***To err*** *is human.*
*   ***To travel the world*** *is my dream.*
*   **Transformation:** We usually move long infinitives to the end using "It".
    *   *It is my dream **to travel the world**.*

## 3. Clausal Subjects (Idea Subjects)
An entire **clause** (group of words with S+V) acts as the subject. These are advanced structures for complex ideas.

### A. That-Clauses (Facts)
*   ***That he lied*** *surprised me.* (The fact that he lied).
*   **Note:** "That" must be included at the start of a sentence.

### B. Wh-Clauses (Interrogative Content)
*   ***What she said*** *was interesting.*
*   ***Where he went*** *remains a mystery.*
*   **Word Order:** Use statement order (S+V), not question order inside the clause.

### C. Whether-Clauses (Uncertainty)
*   ***Whether we win or lose*** *is not important.*

## 4. Key Rules

### A. Agreement
Verbal and Clausal subjects are always **SINGULAR**.
*   *[That they are late] **does** not matter.*

### B. Extraposition (The "It" Shift)
Because these subjects are "heavy," English prefers moving them to the end of the sentence.
*   *Heavy:* **Whether she likes it** is not the point.
*   *Natural:* **It** is not the point **whether she likes it**.
