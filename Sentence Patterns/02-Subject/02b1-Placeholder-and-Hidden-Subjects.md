# Placeholder & Hidden Subjects — Detailed Guide

## 1. Overview
In English, every sentence (except commands) must have a visible subject. When the "real" subject is missing, unknown, or pushed to the end, we use **Placeholder** or **Hidden** subjects.

## 2. Placeholder (Dummy/Expletive) Subjects
These words fill the "Subject" slot but have no intrinsic meaning.

### A. Dummy "It"
Used for weather, time, distance, and environment.
*   ***It** is raining.* (Who is raining? No one. 'It' is empty.)
*   ***It** is 5 o'clock.*
*   ***It** is five miles to the beach.*

### B. Existential "There"
Used to state that something **exists** or is present.
*   ***There** is a cat.*
*   ***There** are many people.* (Note: Verb agrees with the *following* noun).

---

## 3. Delayed Subjects (Extraposition)
A **Delayed Subject** occurs when the real subject (usually a long clause or infinitive) is moved to the end of the sentence for "End Weight."

*   **Pattern:** Dummy (It) + Verb + **REAL SUBJECT**
*   ***It** is important **to drink water***. (Real Subject: To drink water).
*   ***It** is obvious **that he lied***. (Real Subject: That he lied).

---

## 4. Hidden (Implicit) Subjects
Occurs when the subject is not spoken but is understood by context. This happens in **Imperative Sentences** (Commands).

*   **Understood Subject:** Always **"You"**.
*   *Sentence:* **Stop!**
*   *Grammar:* **(You)** Stop!
*   *Other Examples:* **Please sit down.** / **Don't touch that.**
