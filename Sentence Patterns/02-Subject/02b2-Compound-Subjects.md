# Compound Subject — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
A **Compound Subject** consists of two or more simple subjects that share the same verb. They are joined by coordinating conjunctions (usually *and*, *or*, *nor*).

## 2. Agreement Rules

### A. Joined by "AND"
Subjects joined by **and** typically take a **PLURAL** verb.
*   ***Jack and Jill*** **are** going up the hill.
*   ***The dog and the cat*** **fight** all the time.

**Exception:** If the two nouns refer to the *same person/thing* or a *single unit*.
*   ***Peanut butter and jelly*** **is** delicious. (Considered one food dish).
*   ***The founder and CEO*** **is** speaking. (One person holds two titles).

### B. Joined by "OR" / "NOR"
When joined by **or**, **nor**, **either...or**, or **neither...nor**, the verb agrees with the subject **closest to it** (Proximity Rule).
*   *Neither the players nor the **coach*** **is** happy. (Coach is singular => is).
*   *Neither the coach nor the **players*** **are** happy. (Players is plural => are).
