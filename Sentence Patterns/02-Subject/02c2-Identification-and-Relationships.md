# Subject Identification & Relationships — Detailed Guide

## 1. Finding the Subject (The Tests)
In complex sentences, the subject can be hidden. Use these tests to find it.

### Test 1: The "Who/What" Question
Find the verb and ask "Who or what [verb]?"
*   *In the dark, a loud **noise** woke me.*
*   *What woke me?* -> **noise**.

### Test 2: The Tag Question Test
Add a tag question to the end. The pronoun in the tag refers only to the subject.
*   *The boss, with his team, is leaving, **isn't HE**?*
*   *Pronoun 'He' refers to 'boss'.* -> **Subject: The boss**.

### Test 3: Yes/No Question Test
Turn the sentence into a question. The subject swaps with the helper verb.
*   *The boy in the red shirt was there.* -> *Was **the boy in the red shirt** there?*

## 2. Subject-Verb-Complement Relationship
A **Subject Complement (Cs)** follows a linking verb (be, seem, look) and describes or renames the subject.

*   ***He = a teacher.** ('teacher' renames 'He').
*   ***She -> happy.** ('happy' describes 'She').

### Types of Complements
1.  **Noun Phrase:** *He is **a doctor**.*
2.  **Adjective:** *She looks **tired**.*
3.  **Prepositional Phrase:** *The keys are **on the table**.*
4.  **Clause:** *The issue is **that he is late**.*

## 3. Positioning: Inverted Subjects
Usually, the subject comes first. In inverted structures, it moves after the verb.
*   **Questions:** *Where are **the files**?*
*   **Locative:** *Down fell **the rain**.*
*   **Negative:** *Never have **I** seen such a thing.*
