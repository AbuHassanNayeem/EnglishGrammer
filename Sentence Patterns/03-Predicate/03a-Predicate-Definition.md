# The Predicate — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
The **Predicate** is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other being the **Subject**). 
*   **Function:** It tells something about the subject. It expresses the action done by the subject or the state/condition of the subject.
*   **Components:** The predicate **always** includes a Verb. It may also include Objects, Complements, and Adverbials.

*   *Sentence:* **The dogs** **barked loudly**.
    *   **Subject:** The dogs
    *   **Predicate:** barked loudly

## 2. Classification of Predicates

### A. Simple Predicate
This consists ONLY of the **Main Verb** (and its auxiliaries/helpers). It excludes modifiers, objects, etc.
*   *Sentence:* The large dog **barked** at the man.
    *   *Simple Predicate:* **barked**
*   *Sentence:* She **has been singing** all day.
    *   *Simple Predicate:* **has been singing**

### B. Complete Predicate
This consists of the **Verb** plus all accompanying words (modifiers, objects, complements, phrases). Basically, everything that is not the subject.
*   *Sentence:* **The large dog** [barked at the man with anger].
    *   *Complete Predicate:* **barked at the man with anger**

### C. Compound Predicate
This occurs when one subject performs **two or more actions**. The verbs are connected by a conjunction (and, but, or).
*   *Sentence:* Use subject **he**.
    *   *Predicate 1:* woke up
    *   *Predicate 2:* stretched
*   *Result:* He **woke up and stretched**.
    *   *Compound Predicate:* **woke up and stretched**

## 3. Properties of the Predicate (The Verb Phrase)

The Predicate carries essential grammatical information:
1.  **Tense:** Time of action (Present, Past, Future).
2.  **Aspect:** Nature of flow (Simple, Continuous, Perfect).
3.  **Voice:** Active or Passive relationship to Subject.
4.  **Mood:** Reality (Indicative) vs Hypothesis (Subjunctive).
5.  **Person/Number:** Agreement with the Subject.

## 4. The "Predicator" (Linguistics Term)
In modern linguistics, the term **Predicator** is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Verb element within the Predicate, distinguishing it from the Objects/Complements which are "Arguments" of the Predicator.

*   *She gave him a book.*
    *   **Subject:** She
    *   **Predicate:** gave him a book
    *   **Predicator:** gave
    *   **Arguments:** She (Subject), him (Indirect Object), a book (Direct Object).

## 5. Recognizing the Predicate Barriers
The Predicate usually starts where the Subject ends.
*   *The man in the red shirt* **is my brother**.
    *   Barrier is after "shirt".

**Interrupters:**
Sometimes adverbials move to the front, splitting the logic, but structurally they belong to the predicate (or are sentence modifiers).
*   *Yesterday, he left.*
    *   Predicate elements: *left* + *Yesterday*.
