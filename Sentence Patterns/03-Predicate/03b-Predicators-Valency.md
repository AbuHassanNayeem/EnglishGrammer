# The Predicator & Valency Theory — Advanced Guide

## 1. What is a Predicator?
The **Predicator** is the verbal head of the clause. It determines the number and type of other elements (Subject, Objects) required in the sentence.

## 2. Valency (Argument Structure)
Just as atoms have valency in chemistry, verbs have valency in grammar. It indicates how many "Arguments" (participants) the verb demands.

### A. Zero-Valent (Avalent)
Requires **zero** arguments. (Only found in "It" weather usages where 'It' is empty).
*   *It rains.* (Predicator: Rains).

### B. Monovalent (Intransitive)
Requires **one** argument (Subject).
*   *He sleeps.*
*   Valency: 1 (He).

### C. Bivalent (Transitive)
Requires **two** arguments (Subject + Object).
*   *She hit the ball.*
*   Valency: 2 (She, Ball).

### D. Trivalent (Ditransitive)
Requires **three** arguments (Subject + IO + DO).
*   *He gave her a gift.*
*   Valency: 3 (He, Her, Gift).

## 3. Adjuncts are NOT Arguments
Arguments are required by the Predicator. Adjuncts (Adverbials) are optional.

*   *He put the book on the table.*
    *   **Put** is Trivalent here (He + Book + On table). You cannot say *"He put the book"*. The Place is an Argument.
*   *He ate the cake in the kitchen.*
    *   **Ate** is Bivalent (He + Cake). "In the kitchen" is an Adjunct (Optional).
