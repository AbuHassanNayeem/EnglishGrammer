# Verb Forms & Morphology — Detailed Guide

## 1. The Five Main Forms

| Form | Technical Name | Example (Regular) | Example (Irregular) | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 2. Regular vs. Irregular Verbs

### A. Regular Verbs
Follow a standard pattern: **add -ed** for both V2 and V3.
*   *Walk -> Walked -> Walked*
*   *Play -> Played -> Played*
*   **Spelling Rules:**
    *   Ends in 'e': add 'd' (*Dance -> Danced*)
    *   Ends in CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant): double the last letter (*Stop -> Stopped*)
    *   Ends in 'y': change to 'ied' (*Study -> Studied*)

### B. Irregular Verbs
Do **not** follow the -ed rule. They must be memorized.
*   **Three forms same:** *Cut - Cut - Cut*
*   **V2/V3 same:** *Buy - Bought - Bought*
*   **All different:** *Go - Went - Gone*

## 3. Finite vs. Non-Finite Verbs

### Finite Verbs (Tensed)
*   Limit the sentence in time.
*   Agree with a subject.
*   *Example:* She **works** hard. (Tense: Present, Subject: She).

### Non-Finite Verbs (Untensed)
*   Do not show time.
*   Do not change for subject.
*   **Infinitive:** He wants **to work**.
*   **Gerund:** **Working** is hard.
*   **Participle:** The **working** man.
