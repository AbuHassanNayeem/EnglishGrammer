# Transitive Verbs — Comprehensive Guide

## 1. What is a Transitive Verb?

A **transitive verb** is an action verb that transmits action to an object. It cannot stand alone; it requires a direct object (DO) to complete its thought.

*   **Logic:** The action "crosses over" (*trans* = across) from the subject to an object.
*   **Formula:** Subject + Verb + **Object**
*   **Test:** Can you ask "Whom?" or "What?" after the verb and get an answer?

### Examples
*   *He **kicked** the ball.* (Kicked what? → *The ball* = Transitive)
*   *She **loves** music.* (Loves what? → *Music* = Transitive)
*   *He **sleeps**.* (Sleeps what? → No answer = Intransitive)

---

## 2. The Three Types of Transitivity

Transitive verbs are classified by how many and what kind of objects they take.

### A. Monotransitive (One Object)
Takes a single **Direct Object (DO)**.
*   **Pattern:** S + V + O
*   *She **broke** the vase.* (DO: *the vase*)
*   *I **understand** the problem.* (DO: *the problem*)

### B. Ditransitive (Two Objects)
Takes a **Direct Object** AND an **Indirect Object (IO)**. The IO receives the DO.
*   **Pattern:** S + V + IO + DO
*   *He **gave** **Mary** **advice**.* (IO: *Mary*, DO: *advice*)
*   *She **bought** **me** a coffee.* (IO: *me*, DO: *coffee*)

**Dative Shift (The "To" vs. "For" Rule):**
Ditransitive sentences can often be rewritten with a prepositional phrase:
1.  **Give-type verbs (use "to"):** give, send, show, lend, tell, offer.
    *   *He gave Mary advice* → *He gave advice **to** Mary.*
2.  **Buy-type verbs (use "for"):** buy, make, get, cook, build, save.
    *   *She bought me coffee* → *She bought coffee **for** me.*

### C. Complex-Transitive (Object + Complement)
Takes a **Direct Object** and an **Object Complement (OC)** that describes or renames the object.
*   **Pattern:** S + V + O + C
*   *They **elected** **him** president.* (OC *president* renames *him*)
*   *We **consider** **the idea** foolish.* (OC *foolish* describes *the idea*)
*   *He **dyed** **his hair** blue.* (OC *blue* describes *hair*)

## 3. Objects: Forms and Functions

The "Object" isn't always just a simple noun.

### Forms of the Direct Object
1.  **Noun Phrase:** *I saw **the black cat**.*
2.  **Pronoun:** *I saw **her**.* (Objective case: me, him, her, us, them)
3.  **Reflexive Pronoun:** *He saw **himself** in the mirror.*
4.  **Muto-Reciprocal Pronoun:** *They helped **each other**.*
5.  **Infinitive/Gerund:** *I like **to swim**.* / *I enjoy **swimming**.*
6.  **Noun Clause:** *I know **that he is lying**.* / *I wonder **who called**.*

## 4. Ambitransitive Verbs (Use Both Ways)

Many verbs can be transitive or intransitive depending on context.

### A. Agentive Ambitransitives (Object Omitted)
The subject remains the "doer" in both cases.
*   **Transitive:** *He **reads** books.*
*   **Intransitive:** *He **reads** every night.*
*   *Others:* eat, drink, sing, write, play, drive.

### B. Ergative Ambitransitives (Subject Change)
The object of the transitive version becomes the subject of the intransitive version.
*   **Transitive:** *John **open**ed **the door**.*
*   **Intransitive:** ***The door** **open**ed.*
*   *Others:* break, melt, boil, freeze, start, stop, change, grow.
*   *Note:* This nuance is crucial for understanding "The ice melted" (Intransitive) vs "The sun melted the ice" (Transitive).

## 5. Passivization

Only transitive verbs can be passive (because you need an object to become the new subject).

### Monotransitive Passive
*   *Active:* *The chef **prepared** the meal.*
*   *Passive:* ***The meal** was **prepared** by the chef.*

### Ditransitive Passive (Two Ways!)
1.  **Promote Indirect Object (Most Common):**
    *   *Active:* *She gave **John** a book.*
    *   *Passive:* ***John** was given a book.*
2.  **Promote Direct Object:**
    *   *Active:* *She gave John **a book**.*
    *   *Passive:* ***A book** was given **to** John.*

### Complex-Transitive Passive
*   *Active:* *They elected **her** president.*
*   *Passive:* ***She** was elected president.* (Complement *president* stays).

## 6. Identification Tests

Use these linguistics tests to prove a verb is transitive.

### Test 1: The "What/Whom" Question
*   *Verb:* **wrote**
*   *Q:* Wrote **what**?
*   *A:* **The letter**. -> **Transitive.**

### Test 2: The Passive Transformation
*   *Sentence:* *He sleeps well.*
*   *Passive:* *Well is slept by him?* ❌ (Absurd) -> **Intransitive.**
*   *Sentence:* *He kicks the ball.*
*   *Passive:* *The ball is kicked by him.* ✅ (Valid) -> **Transitive.**

### Test 3: "It" Cleft
Can you emphasize the object with "It was X that..."?
*   *I bought **a car**.* -> *It was **a car** that I bought.* ✅
