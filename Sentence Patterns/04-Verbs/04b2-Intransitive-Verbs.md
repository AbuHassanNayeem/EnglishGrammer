# Intransitive Verbs — Comprehensive Guide

## 1. What is an Intransitive Verb?

An **intransitive verb** is a verb that denotes an action or state that stops with the doer. It does **not** pass on to an object.

*   **Grammatical Rule:** Subject + Verb (NO Object).
*   **Key Concept:** The action is complete within itself or affects only the subject.

### Examples
*   *The baby **cries**.* (Complete thought)
*   *The sun **rose**.* (Complete thought)
*   *The accident **happened** last night.* (Complete thought + Adverbial)

## 2. Advanced Classifications (Linguistics)

In modern grammar, intransitive verbs are divided into two distinct categories based on the role of the subject.

### A. Unergative Verbs (Action)
The subject is an **Agent** (the doer). The action is voluntary or an activity.
*   **Examples:** *run, work, laugh, dance, swim, speak, play.*
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Can often take "Cognate Objects" (e.g., *dream a dream*).
    *   Cannot usually be used as adjectives (e.g., we don't say "the run man").

### B. Unaccusative Verbs (Event/Change)
The subject is a **Patient** or **Theme** (the undergoer). The subject "undergoes" a change of state or location rather than "doing" it actively.
*   **Examples:** *fall, die, melt, arrive, appear, exist, happen, faint, sink, break.*
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Subject acts like the object of a transitive verb.
    *   Can often be used as adjectives in the past participle form:
        *   *The leaves **fell**.* -> *The **fallen** leaves.*
        *   *The ice **melted**.* -> *The **melted** ice.*

## 3. Syntactic Patterns

Intransitive verbs typically follow these sentence structures:

### A. Pure Intransitive (S + V)
Pattern 1. No other words are needed.
*   *Birds **fly**.*
*   *Money **talks**.*
*   *He **fainted**.*

### B. Intransitive with Adverbial (S + V + A)
Pattern 4. The verb requires information about place, time, or manner.
*   *They **live** in London.* (Essential Adverbial - cannot remove)
*   *She **arrived** late.* (Optional Adverbial)
*   *The car **turned** left.*

### C. Prepositional Verbs (S + V + Prep + O)
Many intransitive verbs link to a noun using a specific preposition. Structurally, the verb is intransitive, but the phrase functions like a transitive unit.
*   *He **listens to** music.* (Not: *He listens music.*)
*   *She **waited for** the bus.*
*   *We **look at** the stars.*
*   *We **talked about** politics.*

## 4. Special Intransitive Constructions

While intransitives don't take normal direct objects, they have special exceptions.

### A. Cognate Objects
Some unergative verbs can take an object if that object is related to the verb (a noun form of the verb).
*   *She **smiled** a sad **smile**.*
*   *He **died** a painful **death**.*
*   *They **dreamed** a strange **dream**.*
*   *He **slept** a sound **sleep**.*

### B. Resultative Combinations
Intransitives can describe an action leading to a state.
*   *He **laughed** himself **silly**.* (He laughed until he became silly)
*   *She **cried** herself **to sleep**.*

### C. The "There" Transformation
Unaccusative verbs often work with the "Existential There" structure.
*   *A problem **arose**.* -> ***There arose** a problem.*
*   *A king **lived**.* -> ***There lived** a king.*
*   (Unergatives don't usually do this: *There worked a man* is odd/archaic).

## 5. Confusing Pairs (Transitive vs. Intransitive)

English has pairs of verbs that look similar but distinct in transitivity. This is a common source of error.

| Intransitive (No Object) | Transitive (Needs Object) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rise** (*rose, risen*)<br>*The sun rises.* | **Raise** (*raised, raised*)<br>*Raise **your hand**.* |
| **Lie** (*lay, lain*)<br>*I need to lie down.* | **Lay** (*laid, laid*)<br>*Lay **the book** down.* |
| **Sit** (*sat, sat*)<br>*Please sit down.* | **Set** (*set, set*)<br>*Set **the table**.* |
| **Fall** (*fell, fallen*)<br>*The rain falls.* | **Fell** (*felled, felled*)<br>*They felled **the tree**.* (Cut down) |

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Passive Voice with Intransitive Verbs
This is a major error for learners. Since there is no object to become the subject, **intransitive verbs cannot be passive.**
*   *Wrong:* The accident **was happened** yesterday.
*   *Right:* The accident **happened** yesterday.
*   *Wrong:* He **was died** in 1990.
*   *Right:* He **died** in 1990.
*   *Wrong:* The sun **is risen**.
*   *Right:* The sun **has risen** (Active perfect) or **is rising**.

### ❌ Forcing Objects on Intransitive Verbs
*   *Wrong:* She **smiled** me.
*   *Right:* She **smiled at** me.
*   *Wrong:* He **waited** the bus.
*   *Right:* He **waited for** the bus.
*   *Wrong:* I **graduated** the university.
*   *Right:* I **graduated from** the university.

### ❌ Confusing Ambitransitive Uses
Some verbs change meaning.
*   *Run:*
    *   *He runs.* (Intransitive: moves fast)
    *   *He runs the company.* (Transitive: manages)
*   *Growing:*
    *   *The plant is growing.* (Intransitive: getting bigger)
    *   *He is growing carrots.* (Transitive: cultivating)

> 3. Please **set** the cup on the table. (Sit is intransitive)
