# Semantic Verb Types — Detailed Guide

## 1. Introduction
While grammar describes the structure of verbs (transitive, passive, etc.), **Semantics** describes their actual meaning and nature. This guide covers the four primary semantic categories of English verbs.

## 2. Action Verbs (Dynamic Verbs)
Action verbs describe what the subject *does*—a physical or mental action that happens over time.
*   **Key Feature:** They can be used in **Continuous (Progressive) Tenses**.

    *   *Examples:* Run, Jump, Eat, Write, Kick, Laugh, Drive.
    *   *Sentence:* The horse **jumped** over the fence.
2.  **Mental/Process Actions:** Internal activities.
    *   *Examples:* Read, Study, Calculate, Plan, Design.
    *   *Sentence:* I am **studying** for the exam.

## 3. State & Condition Verbs (Stative Verbs)
State verbs describe a state of being, a feeling, or a condition.
*   **Key Rule:** They are **NOT** usually used in Continuous Tenses.

### Categories of State Verbs
