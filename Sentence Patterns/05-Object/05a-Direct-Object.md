# Direct Object (DO) — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
The **Direct Object** is the entity that directly receives the action of the verb. It answers the question "What?" or "Whom?" after the verb.

*   *She hit **the ball**.* (Hit what? -> The ball).

## 2. Advanced Classifications

### A. Effected Object (Result of Action)
The object comes into existence *because* of the action.
*   *She baked **a cake**.* (The cake didn't exist before).
*   *He wrote **a poem**.*

### B. Affected Object (Recipient of Action)
The object exists beforehand and is changed or touched by the action.
*   *She kicked **the dog**.* (The dog was already there).
*   *He painted **the wall**.*

### C. Cognate Object
An object that is semantically related to the verb (usually with intransitive verbs turned transitive).
*   *He died **a peaceful death**.*
*   *She dreamed **a strange dream**.*
*   *They fought **a good fight**.*

### D. Dummy Object (It)
Used in idiomatic expressions where "it" has no meaning.
*   *Beat **it**!*
*   *Rough **it**.*
*   *Call **it** a day.*

## 3. Position and Movement
Usually follows the verb immediately. Can only be separated by an Indirect Object.
*   *He read **the book** quickly.* (Pattern: V + O + A)
*   *He read quickly **the book**.* ❌ (Adverb usually can't come between V and DO unless object is very long).

**Heavy Noun Phrase Shift:**
If the object is very long, it can move to the end.
*   *He explained **clearly** [the reasons explicitly stated in the document we found yesterday].*
