# Indirect Object (IO) — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
The **Indirect Object** identifies the **recipient** or **beneficiary** of the action. It answers "To whom?" or "For whom?"

*   *She gave **me** the key.* (Me = To whom).

---

## 2. Dative Shift (Alternation)
English allows two structures for ditransitive verbs.

### Structure A: Double Object Construction
**S + V + IO + DO**
*   *I showed **him** the map.*
*   *Use when:* The IO is short (pronoun) or needs emphasis.

### Structure B: Prepositional Construction
**S + V + DO + Prep + IO**
*   *I showed the map **to him**.*
*   *Use when:* The IO is long ("to the man standing in the corner") or for focus.

## 3. "To" vs "For" - The Two Groups

### Group 1: The "Give" Type (Takes TO)
Motion or transfer towards someone.
*   *Verbs:* Give, lend, pass, send, throw, show, tell, teach, offer, promise.
*   *Pass **me** the salt.* / *Pass the salt **to me**.*

### Group 2: The "Buy" Type (Takes FOR)
Beneficiary (doing a favor).
*   *Verbs:* Buy, get, make, cook, bake, order, build, save, find, choose.
*   *Make **me** a cake.* / *Make a cake **for me**.*

### Group 3: Non-Alternating (Preposition Only)
Some verbs usually require the preposition (explain, donate, introduce).
*   *Explain **me** the rule.* ❌ (Common Error)
*   *Explain the rule **to me**.* ✅
*   *He donated **the charity** money.* ❌
*   *He donated money **to the charity**.* ✅

## 4. Restrictions
*   **Pronoun Rule:** If both objects are pronouns, putting IO first is sometimes awkward in American English, but common in British.
    *   *Give it to me.* (Preferred).
    *   *Give me it.* (Informal/Dialect).
*   **Passive Voice:** Both objects can usually become subjects.
    *   *I was sent a letter.* (IO Subject - Most common).
    *   *A letter was sent to me.* (DO Subject).
