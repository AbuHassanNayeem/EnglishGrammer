# Object of Preposition — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition

## 2. Categories of Prepositional Object

| Type | Example | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Noun / NP** | *He is in **the room**.* | Most common type. |
| **Pronoun** | *Come with **me**.* | Must use **Objective Case** (me, him, her, us, them). |
| **Gerund** | *Thanks for **helping**.* | Action acting as a noun. |
| **Clause** | *I am worried about **what he said**.* | Entire clause acts as the object. |

## 3. Function of the Phrase
The Prepositional Phrase itself acts as a modifier:
1.  **Adjective Phrase:** Modifies a noun.
    *   *The book **on the table** is mine.* (Modifies 'book').
2.  **Adverbial Phrase:** Modifies a verb.
    *   *He ran **into the room**.* (Modifies 'ran').

## 4. Difference from Direct/Indirect Object
*   **Direct/Indirect Object:** Receives action directly from the Verb.
*   **Prepositional Object:** Completes the Preposition. It is "governed" by the preposition, not the verb.
