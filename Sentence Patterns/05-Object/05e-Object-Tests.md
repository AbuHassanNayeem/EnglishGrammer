# Identification Tests for Objects — Detailed Guide

## 1. Why Test?
Sometimes it is hard to tell an Object from a Complement or Adverbial.
*   *He runs fast.* (Fast = Object? No.)
*   *He became a doctor.* (Doctor = Object? No.)

## 2. Test 1: The Active-Passive Conversion
Only Direct Objects (and some Indirect Objects) can become the **Subject** of a passive sentence.

*   *Sentence:* *The boy kicked the ball.*
*   *Test:* *The ball was kicked by the boy.* ✅ (Valid Passive).
    *   **Result:** "The ball" is an Object.
*   *Sentence:* *He became a doctor.*
*   *Test:* *A doctor was become by him.* ❌ (Absurd).
    *   **Result:** "A doctor" is NOT an Object (It is a Complement).
*   *Sentence:* *He runs fast.*
*   *Test:* *Fast is run by him.* ❌
    *   **Result:** "Fast" is NOT an Object (It is an Adverb).

## 3. Test 2: The "What/Whom" Question
Ask "Verb + What?" or "Verb + Whom?"

*   *Sentence:* *She eats apples.*
*   *Q:* Eats what?
*   *A:* **Apples**. (Logical). -> Object.
*   *Sentence:* *She travels tomorrow.*
*   *Q:* Travels what?
*   *A:* Tomorrow? (No, that answers *When*). -> Adverbial.

## 4. Test 3: Pronoun Substitution
Can you replace it with an **Objective Pronoun** (him, her, it, them)?

*   *Sentence:* *I saw **John**.*
*   *Test:* *I saw **him**.* ✅ -> Object.
*   *Sentence:* *It was **John**.* (Subject Complement).
*   *Test:* *It was **him**.* (Informally acceptable, but formally "It was he").
    *   Because Complements rename the subject, strict grammar requires Subjective Case. Objects *always* take Objective Case.
