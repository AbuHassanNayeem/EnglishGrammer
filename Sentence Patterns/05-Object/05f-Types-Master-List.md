## 2. Detailed Notes

### A. Compound Objects
Just like compound subjects, you can have multiple items receiving the action.
*   *I saw **John and Mary**.* (Compound DO).

### B. Reflexive Objects
Used when the action reflects back on the doer.
*   *Pronouns:* Myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves.
*   *Note:* You cannot use a subject pronoun here. (*He hurt him* means he hurt a different male).

### C. Clausal Objects
Usually Noun Clauses starting with *that, if, whether* or *Wh-words*.
*   *I wonder **if he will come**.*
