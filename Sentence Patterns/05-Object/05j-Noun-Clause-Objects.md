# Noun Clause Objects — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
A **Noun Clause** is a complete clause (Subject + Verb) that functions as the object of a sentence. It answers "What?" just like a simple noun.

*   *Structure:* Main Clause + [**Connector + S + V**]

## 2. Types of connector

### A. That-Clauses (Statements)
Used after mental state verbs (*think, know, say, believe*).
*   *I know **that he is here**.*
*   *She said **(that) she is tired**.* (Note: "That" is often omitted).

### B. Wh-Clauses (Information Questions)
Used after verbs of inquiry (*ask, wonder, know*).
*   *I don't know **where he lives**.*
*   *Tell me **what you want**.*
*   *I wonder **why she left**.*

**Note on Word Order:**
In the clause, use **Statement Order** (S+V), not Question Order.
*   *Wrong:* I don't know where **is he**.
*   *Right:* I don't know where **he is**.

### C. If/Whether Clauses (Yes/No Questions)
Used when the original question can be answered with Yes/No.
*   *I don't know **if it will rain**.*
*   *She asked **whether I was ready**.*

## 3. Usage Notes
*   **Tense Backshifting:** If the main verb is past (*said*), the clause verb usually moves to the past (*was*).
    *   *Direct:* "I **am** sick."
    *   *Reported:* He said that he **was** sick.
*   **Subjunctive:** Some verbs (*suggest, insist*) require the subjunctive in the that-clause.
    *   *I suggest **that he be present**.* (Not *is*).
