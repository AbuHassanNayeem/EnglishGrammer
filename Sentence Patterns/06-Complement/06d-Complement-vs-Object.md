# Complement vs. Object — Detailed Guide

## 1. The Core Difference
*   **Object (DO):** A distinct entity from the subject. It receives action.
    *   *I kicked **the ball**.* (I ≠ Ball).
*   **Subject Complement (SC):** The same entity as the subject. It renames/describes.
    *   *I am **a teacher**.* (I = Teacher).

## 2. Test 1: The Equals Sign (=)
Replace the verb with an equals sign.

*   *Sentence:* *She feels tired.*
*   *Test:* She = Tired? ✅ (Makes sense). -> **Complement**.
*   *Sentence:* *She feels the fabric.*
*   *Test:* She = Fabric? ❌ (Absurd). -> **Object** (She is touching it).

---

## 3. Test 2: Passive Voice
Objects can become passive subjects. Complements CANNOT.

*   *Sentence:* *He became a doctor.*
*   *Passive:* *A doctor was become by him?* ❌ -> **Complement**.
*   *Sentence:* *He met a doctor.*
*   *Passive:* *A doctor was met by him.* ✅ -> **Object**.

## 4. Test 3: The "As" Insertion (for Object Complements)
For Object Complements, you can often insert "as" or "to be" between the Object and Complement.

*   *Sentence:* *They elected him president.*
*   *Test:* *They elected him **as** president.* ✅ -> **Object Complement**.
*   *Sentence:* *She calls him John.* (Him = John). -> **Object Complement**.
*   *Sentence:* *She showed him John.* (Him ≠ John. He is seeing John). -> **Two Objects (IO + DO)**.
