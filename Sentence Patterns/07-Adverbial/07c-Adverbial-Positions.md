# Position and Order of Adverbials — Detailed Guide

## 1. Three Main Positions

### A. Front (Initial)
Before the subject. Used for emphasis, setting the scene, or connecting to previous sentences.
*   ***Yesterday**, I worked.*
*   ***Suddenly**, the door opened.*

### B. Mid (Medial)
Between the Subject and Main Verb (or after the first auxiliary).
*   *I **always** work hard.*
*   *I have **never** seen that.*
*   *He is **probably** right.* (After "be").

### C. End (Final)
After the verb (and object). The neutral and most common position.
*   *I worked **yesterday**.*
*   *She sings **beautifully**.*

## 2. Order of Multiple Adverbials (End Position)
When you have multiple adverbials at the end, use the **M-P-T** Rule:
**Manner** -> **Place** -> **Time**

*   *Correct:* She sang **beautifully** (M) **at the concert** (P) **last night** (T).
*   *Wrong:* She sang last night at the concert beautifully. ❌

**Exception:** Verbs of movement (Go, Arrive) prefer **Place** -> **Manner** -> **Time**.
*   *He went **to school** (P) **quickly** (M) **yesterday** (T).*

## 3. Order of Specific vs General
If you have two of the same type (e.g., two Time phrases), put the **Smaller/Specific** before the **Larger/General**.

*   *I was born **at 5 PM** (Specific) **on Sunday** (Larger).*
*   *He lives **in an apartment** (Specific) **in New York** (Larger).*

## 4. Practice Exercises

### Reorder the sentences:
1. (last year / to Japan / went / he)
2. (at the party / danced / she / wildly)
3. (at 6:00 / I / wake up / usually)

> **Answers:**
> 1. He **went to Japan last year**. (Place before Time).
> 2. She **danced wildly at the party**. (Manner before Place).
> 3. I **usually wake up at 6:00**. (Frequency in Mid, Time in End).

## 5. Flexibility of Position (Example)
Adverbials are the most movable element in a sentence.
*   **Beginning:** ***Yesterday**, I went to the market.* (Emphasis on Time).
*   **Middle:** *I, **yesterday**, went to the market.* (Rare, poetic, distinct emphasis).
*   **End:** *I went to the market **yesterday**.* (Neutral standard position).
