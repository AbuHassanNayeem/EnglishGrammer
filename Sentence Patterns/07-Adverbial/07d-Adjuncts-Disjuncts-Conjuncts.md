# Adverbial Classes: Adjuncts, Disjuncts, Conjuncts — Advanced Guide

## 1. Introduction
Linguists classify adverbials based on how integrated they are into the sentence structure.

---

## 2. Adjuncts (Integrated)
Part of the core meaning. If removed, the sentence loses essential detail.
*   **Function:** Tells *what happened*.
*   *He ran **fast**.*
*   *She lives **in Paris**.*
*   **Test:** Can be the focus of a question?
    *   *Where does she live? In Paris.* (Yes).

---

## 3. Disjuncts (Commentary)
Not part of the action. They express the **speaker's attitude** or **stance**.
*   **Function:** Tells *what the speaker thinks*.
*   ***Frankly**, I don't care.* (I am being frank).
*   ***Fortunately**, no one was hurt.*
*   *He is **probably** lying.*
*   **Test:** Can be the focus of a question?
    *   *Did no one get hurt? Fortunately.* (No, "Fortunately" isn't the action).

---

## 4. Conjuncts (Connectors)
Connect the sentence to the previous one.
*   **Function:** Tells *how sentences relate*.
*   *He studied hard. **However**, he failed.*
*   *I like tea. **Also**, I like coffee.*
*   ***Therefore**, we must go.*
