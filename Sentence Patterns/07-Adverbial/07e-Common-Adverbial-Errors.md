# Common Adverbial Errors — Detailed Guide

## 1. Adjective vs Adverb Confusion
Adjectives modify Nouns. Adverbs modify Verbs/Adjectives.
*   *Wrong:* He ran **quick**.
*   *Right:* He ran **quickly**.
*   *Exception:* Short adverbs (flat adverbs) like *fast, hard, late* stay the same.
    *   *Right:* He runs **fast**. (Not fastly).

## 2. "Hardly" vs "Hard"
They have completely different meanings.
*   **Hard:** With effort. (*He works **hard**.*)
*   **Hardly:** Barely. (*He **hardly** works.* = He does almost nothing).

## 3. "Late" vs "Lately"
*   **Late:** Not on time. (*He arrived **late**.*)
*   **Lately:** Recently. (*I haven't seen him **lately**.*)

## 4. Misplaced Modifiers
Putting the adverbial in the wrong spot can change meaning (The "Only" Rule).
*   ***Only** I hit him.* (Nobody else did).
*   *I **only** hit him.* (I didn't kick him).
*   *I hit **only** him.* (I didn't hit anyone else).

## 5. Double Negatives with Adverbs
*   *Wrong:* I **can't** **hardly** see.
*   *Right:* I **can** **hardly** see.
