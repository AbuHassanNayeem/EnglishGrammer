# Existential "There" and "Here" — Detailed Examples

## Pattern Structure

**Existential Construction:** There/Here + Verb + Subject (+ Optional Elements)

Existential sentences use "there" or "here" as an introducer (expletive) to present or announce the existence or presence of something. The logical subject appears after the verb.

**Key Difference from Locative Inversion:**
- **Existential "there"** = expletive (no meaning, just grammatical function)
- **Locative "there"** = actual adverbial of place

---

## Existential "There"

"There" as an expletive has no referential meaning; it simply introduces the real subject.

## Summary

**Existential "There/Here"** introduces subjects:

✅ "There/Here" = expletive (grammatical function, no meaning)  
✅ Verb agrees with logical subject after the verb  
✅ Common with "be" verb, also with exist, live, remain, etc.  
✅ Introduces new or indefinite subjects  
✅ Presents existence, presence, or availability  
✅ Different from locative "there" (actual place)

**Key Test:** Can you remove "there" and restructure? If subject is indefinite, existential "there" is natural.
