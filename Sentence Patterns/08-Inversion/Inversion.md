# Inversion — Chapter Index

## 1. Introduction
**Inversion** is the reversal of the typical Subject-Verb word order. In standard English, the Subject comes first (`S + V`). In inverted sentences, the Verb (or Auxiliary) comes before the Subject (`V + S` or `Aux + S`).

This chapter covers the rules, types, and stylistic uses of inversion.

## 4. Key Rules
*   **Pronouns:** Locative inversion usually does **not** work with pronoun subjects (*Here he comes*, not *Here comes he*).
*   **Auxiliaries:** Negative and Question inversion require an auxiliary verb (*do, be, have, modals*).
