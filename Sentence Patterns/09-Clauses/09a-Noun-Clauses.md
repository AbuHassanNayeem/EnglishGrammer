# Noun Clauses — Detailed Guide

## 1. Definition
A **Noun Clause** is a dependent clause that acts exactly like a Noun. It can be a Subject, Object, or Complement.

*   **Test:** Can you replace the clause with "IT" or "SOMETHING"?
    *   *I know [that he is lying].* -> *I know [it].* (Yes -> Noun Clause).

## 2. Three Main Types

### A. That-Clauses (Declarative)
Used to state facts, ideas, or beliefs.
*   **As Object:** *I believe **that she is right**.*
*   **As Subject:** ***That he failed** surprised me.*
*   **As Complement:** *The truth is **that we are lost**.*
*   **Note:** The word "that" can often be omitted in object position. (*I believe she is right.*)

### B. Wh-Clauses (Interrogative)
Derived from questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How).
*   *I don't know **where he lives**.* (Statement, not question).
*   *Can you tell me **what time it is**?*
*   ***What he said** was rude.* (Subject).

### C. If/Whether Clauses (Yes/No Questions)
Used for alternatives or uncertainty.
*   *I wonder **if he will come**.*
*   *I don't know **whether to go or stay**.*
*   **Rule:** "Whether" is more formal and required after prepositions.
    *   *I am worried **about whether** we can afford it.* (Not "about if").

## 3. The Subjunctive in Noun Clauses
After verbs of demand/suggestion (insist, suggest, recommend), use the **Base Form**.
*   *I suggest that he **study** hard.* (Not "studies").
*   *She insisted that I **be** present.* (Not "was").

## 4. Extraposition (The "It" Dummy)
When a Noun Clause is the subject, we often move it to the end and put "It" at the start.
*   *Awkward:* **That he likes you** is obvious.
*   *Natural:* **It** is obvious **that he likes you**.
