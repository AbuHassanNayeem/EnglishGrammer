## 3. Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive

### A. Restrictive (Defining)
Essential information. Identifies *which one*. **NO COMMAS.**
*   *The student **who works hard** will succeed.*
    *   (Only the hard-working ones. Not all students).
*   *Use **That** or **Which/Who**.*

### B. Non-Restrictive (Non-Defining)
Extra information. **COMMAS REQUIRED.**
*   *My father, **who works hard**, is tired.*
    *   (I only have one father; the clause just adds info).
*   *Use **Which/Who**. NEVER use **That**.*
    *   *Wrong:* My father, that works hard...

## 4. Omitting the Pronoun (Reduced Clauses)
You can delete the pronoun if it is the **Object** of the clause.
*   *Full:* The book **that** I read.
*   *Reduced:* The book I read. (Common and correct).

You CANNOT delete if it is the Subject.
*   *Full:* The man **who** came.
*   *Reduced:* The man came? (No, this changes meaning to a main clause).

---

## 5. Identifying Prepositions
Formal English puts the preposition before "Whom/Which".
*   *Formal:* The house **in which** I live.
*   *Informal:* The house **which** I live **in**.
*   *Informal:* The house **that** I live **in**.
*   *Very Informal:* The house I live **in**.
