## 3. Punctuation Rule (The Comma)
*   **If the clause comes FIRST:** Use a comma.
    *   *Because he was late**,** he missed the bus.*
*   **If the clause comes LAST:** usually NO comma.
    *   *He missed the bus because he was late.*
    *   *Exception:* Concession clauses often take a comma even at the end (*I went, although I was tired*).

## 4. Reducing Adverbial Clauses
If the Subject is the same in both clauses, you can reduce it to a phrase.
*   *Full:* ***While I was** walking*, I fell.
*   *Reduced:* ***While walking**, I fell.* (Or just *Walking down the street...*)
*   *Wrong:* ***While walking**, the rain started.* (Dangling Modifier! The rain was not walking).
