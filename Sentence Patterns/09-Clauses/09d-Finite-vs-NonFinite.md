# Finite vs. Non-Finite Clauses — Detailed Guide

## 1. The Distinction
*   **Finite Clause:** Has a Tensed Verb and a Subject. Shows time (Past/Present).
    *   *I **know** that he **is** here.*
*   **Non-Finite Clause:** Has no Tensed Verb. Uses Infinitives, Gerunds, or Participles.
    *   *I want **to go**.* (To go = Non-finite).
    *   ***walking** down the street, I saw him.*

## 2. Types of Non-Finite Clauses

### A. To-Infinitive Clause
*   **Purpose:** *I went **to buy milk**.* (Adverbial function).
*   **Object:** *I want **to sleep**.* (Noun function).
*   **Post-modifier:** *The best place **to eat**.* (Adjective function).

### B. Bare Infinitive Clause
*   Used after causative verbs (make, let) or perception verbs (see, hear).
*   *He made me **do it**.* (Not "to do").
*   *I saw him **run**.*

### C. -Ing Participle Clause
*   **Active Meaning.**
*   *The man **standing there** is my brother.* (Relative: *who is standing*).
*   ***Seeing the danger**, I ran.* (Adverbial: *Because I saw*).

### D. -Ed Past Participle Clause

## 3. Ambiguity and Dangling Modifiers
Non-finite clauses don't have a visible subject, so the reader assumes the Subject is the same as the Main Clause.
*   *Wrong:* ***Driving down the road**, the trees looked beautiful.*
    *   (Implies the trees were driving).
*   *Right:* ***Driving down the road**, I looked at the beautiful trees.*
