# Clauses — Chapter Index

## 1. Introduction
A **Clause** is the building block of longer sentences. Unlike a phrase, a clause MUST contain a **Subject** and a **Verb**.

Clauses are either **Independent** (Sentences) or **Dependent** (Fragments acting as Nouns, Adjectives, or Adverbs).

This chapter details the grammar of subordinate clauses.
