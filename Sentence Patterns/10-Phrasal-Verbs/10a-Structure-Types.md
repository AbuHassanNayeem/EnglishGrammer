# Structure & Types of Phrasal Verbs — Detailed Guide

## 1. Intransitive (No Object)
These verbs have no object. The particle always stays next to the verb.
*   *The plane **took off**.*
*   *My car **broke down**.*
*   *He suddenly **showed up**.*
*   **Rule:** You cannot separate them. (*The plane took off.* Not *The plane took itself off.*)

## 2. Transitive (Takes an Object)

### A. Separable Phrasal Verbs (Most Common)
You can put the object **after** the particle OR **between** the verb and particle.
*   *I **turned on** the light.* (Verb + Part + Obj)
*   *I **turned** the light **on**.* (Verb + Obj + Part)

**The Pronoun Rule:**
If the object is a **pronoun** (it, them, me, you, him, her, us), it **MUST** go in the middle.
*   *Correct:* Turn **it** on.
*   *Incorrect:* Turn on **it**. ❌

### B. Inseparable Phrasal Verbs (Prepositional Verbs)
The object MUST go **after** the particle, even if it is a pronoun.
*   *I **ran into** John.*
*   *I **ran into** him.* (Not *ran him into*).
*   *I **looked after** the baby.* (Not *looked the baby after*).

## 3. How to know if it's Separable?
There is no visual way to tell. You must learn them interaction by interaction.
*   **Separable:** call off, fill out, take down, turn on/off, give back.
*   **Inseparable:** look for, look after, run into, come across, get over.
