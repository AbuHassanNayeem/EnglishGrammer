# Basic Subject-Verb Agreement — Detailed Guide

## 1. The Golden Rule
**The Verb must agree with the Subject in Number and Person.**

*   **Singular Subject** -> **Singular Verb** (Often ends in -s).
    *   *The dog bark**s**.*
*   **Plural Subject** -> **Plural Verb** (No -s).
    *   *The dogs bark.*

## 2. Ignoring Interrupters
Do NOT be distracted by words that come between the Subject and Verb.

### A. Prepositional Phrases
*   *The **box** [of chocolates] **is** heavy.*
    *   (Subject is Box, not Chocolates).
*   *The **leader** [of the wolves] **howls**.*

### B. Appositives
*   *Mr. Jones, [the owner of the shops], **is** rich.*

### C. "Together with", "As well as"
These are **Prepositions**, not Conjunctions. They do NOT make the subject plural.
*   *The **teacher**, [along with the students], **was** late.*
    *   (Subject is Teacher).
*   ***John**, [as well as his friends], **is** coming.*

## 3. Inverted Sentences
Find the subject *after* the verb.
*   *There **are** four **apples**.* (Subject: Apples).
*   *Here **comes** the **bus**.* (Subject: Bus).

## 4. Practice Exercises

### Choose the Correct Verb:
1. The list of items (is/are) long.
2. The politicians, along with the president, (was/were) arrested.

> **Answers:**
> 1. **is** (Subject: List).
> 2. **was** (Subject: Politicians? No, Subject: Politicians is Plural? Wait. Example 2 subject is "Politicians"... "Politicians were arrested" would be correct. BUT "The politician, along with the president..." -> singular.
>    *Correction for Q2:* "The politicians (Plural), along with the president, **were** arrested."
>    *Additional:* "The president, along with the politicians, **was** arrested."
