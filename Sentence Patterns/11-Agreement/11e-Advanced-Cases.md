# Advanced Agreement Cases — Detailed Guide

## 1. Relative Clauses
**Rule:** The verb in the clause agrees with the **Antecedent** (the word before *who/which/that*).

*   *He is the **man** who **writes** well.* (Man -> Writes).
*   *They are the **men** who **write** well.* (Men -> Write).

**The Tricky "One of those..." Construction:**
*   *He is **one** of those **people** who **complain**.*
    *   (Antecedent is *People* -> Plural verb *Complain*).
    *   Logic: Of those people who complain, he is one.
*   *He is the **only one** of those people who **complains**.*
    *   (Antecedent is *One* -> Singular verb *Complains*).
