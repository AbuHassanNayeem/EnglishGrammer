# Second & Third Conditionals — Detailed Guide

## 1. Second Conditional (Hypothetical Present/Future)

### Structure
**If + Past Simple, would + Base Verb**

### Usage
Expresses unreal, imaginary, or unlikely present/future situations.

### Examples
- *If I **were** rich, I **would travel** the world.* (I'm not rich)
- *If I **had** a car, I **would drive** to work.* (I don't have a car)
- *If she **studied** harder, she **would pass**.* (She doesn't study hard)

### The Subjunctive "Were"
For "be" in conditionals, use **were** for all persons (formal):
- *If I **were** you, I would apologize.*
- *If he **were** here, he would help.*

*(Note: "If I was" is increasingly common in informal speech)*

## 2. Third Conditional (Hypothetical Past)

### Structure
**If + Past Perfect, would have + Past Participle**

### Usage
Expresses regret, criticism, or impossible past situations (cannot be changed).

### Examples
- *If I **had studied**, I **would have passed**.* (I didn't study, so I failed)
- *If you **had told** me, I **would have helped**.* (You didn't tell me)
- *If we **had left** earlier, we **wouldn't have missed** the train.*

### Key Point
The past is **unchangeable**—this expresses what could have been different.
