# Wish, Hope, If Only — Detailed Guide

## 1. Wish (Regrets & Unreal Desires)

### Wish + Past Simple (Present Regret)
Expresses dissatisfaction with the **present** situation.

**Structure:** Wish + Past Simple / were

**Examples:**
- *I **wish** I **were** taller.* (I'm not tall - I want to be)
- *She **wishes** she **had** more time.* (She doesn't have time)
- *I **wish** I **could** speak French.* (I can't speak French)

### Wish + Past Perfect (Past Regret)  
Expresses regret about the **past** (cannot change).

**Structure:** Wish + Past Perfect

**Examples:**
- *I **wish** I **had studied** harder.* (I didn't study - now I regret it)
- *She **wishes** she **had gone** to the party.* (She didn't go - she regrets it)
- *I **wish** I **hadn't said** that.* (I said it - I regret it)

### Wish + would (Annoyance/Request for Change)
Expresses **annoyance** about someone's behavior or a request for change.

**Examples:**
- *I **wish** you **would listen** to me!* (You don't listen - it annoys me)
- *I **wish** it **would stop** raining.* (The rain continues - I want it to stop)

**Note:** NOT used with "I wish I would..." (you can't be annoyed with yourself).

## 3. Hope (Real Possibility)

### Hope vs Wish
- **Hope:** Possible/likely future event
- **Wish:** Unreal/unlikely/regretful

**Hope Structure:** Hope + Present/Future
