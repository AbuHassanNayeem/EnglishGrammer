## 3. Exceptions: No Backshift Needed

### A. Still True Facts
If the statement is still true now, backshift is optional:
- *"The Earth **is** round." → He said the Earth **is**/was round.*
- *"Paris **is** in France." → She said Paris **is**/was in France.*

### B. Recent Speech (Present Reporting)
If reporting immediately, no backshift:
- *"I'm tired." → He **says** he'**s** tired.* (He just said it now)

### C. Past Perfect (Already past)
Past Perfect doesn't shift further:
- *"I **had finished**." → He said he **had finished**.*

### D. Modals without past forms
- **Should, ought to, might, would, could** → No change
- *"You **should** study." → He said I **should** study.*

## 4. Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|:---|:---|
| *He said he **will** come.* | *He said he **would** come.* |
| *She said she **can** help.* | *She said she **could** help.* |
| *He said the sun **was** hot.* (still true) | *He said the sun **is** hot.* (optional) |
