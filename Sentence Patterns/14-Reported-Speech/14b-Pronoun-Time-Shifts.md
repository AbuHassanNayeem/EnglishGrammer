# Pronoun, Time & Place Shifts — Detailed Guide

## 1. Pronoun Changes

When reporting speech, pronouns shift to reflect the new perspective.

### Reference Table

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **I / me** | **he/she / him/her** | *"I am tired." → **He** said **he** was tired.* |
| **we / us** | **they / them** | *"We are ready." → **They** said **they** were ready.* |
| **you** | **I / he / she** | *"You are late." → He told **me** I was late.* |
| **my** | **his / her** | *"My car is red." → She said **her** car was red.* |
| **our** | **their** | *"Our house..." → They said **their** house...* |

### Context Matters
The pronoun change depends on **who** is reporting:
- Tom: *"I am happy."*
- **Sarah reports:** Tom said **he** was happy.
- **Tom reports himself:** I said **I** was happy.
