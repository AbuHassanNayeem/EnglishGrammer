### Basic Patterns

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
|:---|:---|
| **Statement** | *"I am tired." → He said (that) he was tired.* |
| **Yes/No Q** | *"Are you ready?" → She asked if I was ready.* |
| **Wh- Q** | *"Where do you live?" → He asked where I lived.* |
| **Command** | *"Sit down!" → She told me to sit down.* |
| **Request** | *"Please help me." → He asked me to help him.* |

3. **Shift time words** (tomorrow→the next day)
4. **Use if/whether** for Yes/No questions
