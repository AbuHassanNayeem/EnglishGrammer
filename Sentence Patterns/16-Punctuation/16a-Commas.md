# Commas — Detailed Guide

## 1. Commas in Lists & Series

### Structure
**Item, item, item, and item** (Oxford comma optional)

### Examples
- *I bought apples, oranges, and bananas.* (Oxford comma - recommended)
- *I bought apples, oranges and bananas.* (No Oxford comma)

### Oxford Comma Importance
Without it, meaning can change:
- *I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.* (Ambiguous - are they your parents?)
- *I love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.* (Clear - three separate entities)

## 2. Commas with Coordinating Conjunctions(FANBOYS)

### Rule
Use comma before FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) when joining **two independent clauses**.

### Examples
- *I wanted to go**, but** it was raining.* (Two complete sentences)
- *I wanted to go **but** stayed home.* (No comma - same subject)

### Test
If you can split it into two complete sentences, use comma:
- ✅ *I wanted to go. It was raining.* → Comma needed
- ❌ *I wanted to go. Stayed home.* → No comma (second isn't complete)

## 3. Commas After Introductory Elements

### Introductory Words/Phrases
- *However, I disagree.*
- *Unfortunately, we lost.*
- *To be honest, I don't know.*

### Introductory Clauses
- *When I arrived, the meeting had started.*
- *Because it was late, we went home.*
- *If you need help, call me.*

## 4. Commas with Non-Restrictive Clauses

### Non-Restrictive (Extra Info - Use Commas)
Information can be removed without changing the core meaning.

**Examples:**
- *My brother**, who lives in London,** is visiting.* (I have one brother, extra info)
- *The book**, which I read last week,** was excellent.*

### Restrictive (Essential Info - No Commas)
Information is essential to identify the noun.

**Examples:**
- *My brother **who lives in London** is visiting.* (I have multiple brothers, specifying which one)
- *The book **that I read last week** was excellent.*

### Test
Can you remove the clause in parentheses and still know which noun?
- *My brother (who lives in London) is visiting.* → YES = Non-restrictive (commas)
- *The student (who failed the test) must retake it.* → NO = Restrictive (no commas)

## 5. Common Comma Errors
