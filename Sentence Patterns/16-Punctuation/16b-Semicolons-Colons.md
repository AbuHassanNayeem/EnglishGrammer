# Semicolons & Colons — Detailed Guide

## 1. Semicolons

### Purpose
Connect closely related independent clauses **without** a conjunction.

### A. Connecting Independent Clauses
**Rule:** Both sides must be complete sentences.

**Examples:**
- *I love reading**;** my sister prefers movies.*
- *The exam was difficult**;** I studied hard anyway.*

**Note:** Could also use period, but semicolon shows the ideas are connected.

### B. With Conjunctive Adverbs
**Structure:** Sentence**; connector,** sentence.

**Examples:**
- *It was expensive**; however,** I bought it.*
- *She studied hard**; therefore,** she passed.*

**Common connectors:** However, Therefore, Nevertheless, Moreover, Furthermore

### C. In Complex Lists
When list items themselves contain commas, use semicolons to separate them.

**Example:**
- *The conference has attendees from Paris, France**;** Tokyo, Japan**;** and New York, USA.*

Without semicolons: Unclear how many cities!
- ❌ *Paris, France, Tokyo, Japan, and New York, USA.* (Confusing)

## 2. Colons

### Purpose
Introduce or announce what follows.

### A. Introducing Lists
**Structure:** Independent clause**: list items.**

**Examples:**
- *I need three things**: pens, paper, and a calculator.*
- *She speaks several languages**: French, German, and Spanish.*

**Wrong:** Don't use colon after "such as" or "including":
- ❌ *I like sports such as**: tennis and swimming.*
- ✅ *I like sports such as tennis and swimming.*

### B. Introducing Explanations
**Examples:**
- *There's one problem**: we don't have enough time.*
- *The reason is simple**: I forgot.*

### C. In Time & Ratios
**Examples:**
- *The meeting starts at **3:30** PM.*
- *The ratio is **2:1**.* (Two to one)

### D. After Salutations (Formal Letters)
**Examples:**
- *Dear Sir**:***
- *To Whom It May Concern**:***

| Punctuation | Function | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Semicolon** | Connect equal clauses | *I ran; she walked.* |
| **Colon** | Introduce/announce | *I need one thing: your help.* |

**Test:**

## 4. Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|:---|:---|
| *I love; reading.* | *I love reading.* (semicolon needs two clauses) |
| *He speaks: French and Spanish.* | *He speaks French and Spanish.* (colon needs intro clause) |
| *I like**: tennis, swimming.* | *I like tennis and swimming.* (colons complete sentence before) |
