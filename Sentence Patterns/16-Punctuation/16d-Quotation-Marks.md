# Quotation Marks — Detailed Guide

## 1. Direct Speech

### Structure (American Style)
**"Quoted text," reporting clause.**
**Reporting clause, "quoted text."**

### Examples
- *She said, "I am tired."*
- *"I am tired," she said.*
- *"I am tired," she said, "and I want to go home."*

### Punctuation Rules

**A. Periods and Commas INSIDE quotes (American)**
- ✅ *She said, "Hello**.**"*
- ✅ *"Hello**,**" she said.

**(British Style: Outside if not part of quote)**
- *She said, "Hello"**.**

**B. Question Marks and Exclamation Points**
Place based on what's being questioned/exclaimed:

**Quote is a question:**
- *She asked, "Where are you?"* (Inside)

**Overall sentence is question:**
- *Did she say "hello"?* (Outside)

**Both:**
- *Did she ask "Where are you?"?* (TOO awkward - rewrite!)

## 2. Dialogue Formatting

### Rules
1. **New speaker = New paragraph**
2. **Comma before quote if reporting clause first**
3. **Comma/period/question mark before closing quote**

### Example Dialogue
```
"Where are you going?" asked John.

"To the store," replied Mary.

"Can I come with you?"

"Of course!"
```

## 3. Titles of Works

### Use Quotation Marks For:
- **Short works:** Articles, poems, short stories, songs, episodes
  - *I read "The Tell-Tale Heart" by Poe.* (short story)
  - *My favorite song is "Imagine."*

### Use Italics/Underline For:
- **Long works:** Books, movies, albums, newspapers
  - *I read *To Kill a Mockingbird*.* (novel)
  - *We watched *The Matrix*.* (movie)

## 4. Scare Quotes (Irony/Doubt)

### Usage
Indicates irony, doubt, or non-standard usage of a word.

### Examples
- *He's a "genius" at failing.* (Ironic)
- *The "fresh" fish smelled terrible.* (Doubtful)
- *Click the "submit" button.* (Literal reference to word)

**Warning:** Overuse makes writing seem sarcastic.

## 5. Quoting Within Quotes

### Rule
Use **single quotes** inside double quotes (American).

### Examples
- *She said, "My teacher told me, **'**Study hard,**'** so I did."*
- *He asked, "Did she say **'**I love you**'**?"*

## 6. Common Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|:---|:---|
| *She said "Hello".* | *She said, "Hello."* (comma before quote) |
| *"Hello" she said.* | *"Hello," she said.* (comma inside) |
| *She read "War and Peace".* | *She read *War and Peace*.* (long work = italics) |

---

## 7. Block Quotes (Long Quotes)

### Rule
Quotes longer than 4 lines:
- **Indent** the entire quote
- **No quotation marks**
- **Citation** after

### Example
```
According to Smith (2020):
    The study demonstrated that long-form quotations should be
    formatted differently from short inline quotes to enhance
    readability and conform to academic standards.
```
