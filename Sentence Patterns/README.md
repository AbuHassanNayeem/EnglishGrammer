# Sentence Patterns — Study Guide

Welcome to **Sentence Patterns**, a structured English grammar reference covering the fundamental building blocks of English sentences. This guide is organized by topic and designed for self-paced learning or classroom use.

## Overview

English sentences are built from key grammatical components:
- **Subject (S)** — who or what performs the action
- **Verb (V)** — the action or state
- **Object (O)** — who or what receives the action (direct object)
- **Indirect Object (IO)** — who benefits or receives (in ditransitive sentences)
- **Complement (C)** — information that completes the verb's meaning
- **Adverbial (A)** — additional information (time, place, manner, etc.)

This folder contains detailed references, examples, exercises, and a glossary to help you master these components and the patterns they form.

2. **Work through Core Components** (sections 4–8) in order, reading examples carefully.
3. **Challenge yourself** with Advanced Topics (sections 9–12) and tackle the exercises.
4. **Refer to the Glossary** whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term.

### For Classroom Use
- **Teachers** can assign readings by section and use the exercises for homework or quizzes.
- **Students** can review before exams or use as a reference while writing.

### For Quick Reference
Use the **[Index](./index.md)**, **Glossary**, or search to quickly find a topic or term. Each file includes labeled examples using the notation S, V, O, IO, C, A.

## Key Learning Outcomes

After studying this guide, you should be able to:
- ✅ Identify subject, verb, object, complement, and adverbial in a sentence
- ✅ Distinguish transitive from intransitive verbs
- ✅ Recognize different sentence patterns (simple, compound, complex)
- ✅ Understand subject-verb agreement in various contexts
- ✅ Form and recognize passive voice
- ✅ Identify and use noun, adjective, and adverbial clauses
- ✅ Recognize inversion in questions and stylistic sentences
- ✅ Understand phrasal verbs and their behavior

## Common Notation

Throughout this guide, we use the following labels:
- `S` = Subject
- `V` = Verb
- `O` = Direct Object
- `IO` = Indirect Object
- `C` = Complement
- `A` = Adverbial

**Example:** *She gave him a pen.* (S: She, V: gave, IO: him, O: a pen)

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the definitions** carefully before moving to examples.
2. **Study the labeled examples** — they show how to analyze real sentences.
3. **Use the identification tests** (especially "who/what" and passive conversion tests).
4. **Practice with Exercises** regularly; review answers to understand mistakes.
5. **Reference the Glossary** whenever a term is unfamiliar.
6. **Look for patterns** — many rules have consistent patterns once you understand the basics.

## Recommended Study Schedule

- **Week 1:** Sections 1–3 (Beginner Level)
